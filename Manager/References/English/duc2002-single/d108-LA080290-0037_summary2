The dispute between Iraq and Kuwait began when Iraq accused Kuwait of flooding the oil  market and stealing $2.4 billion worth of oil.
On July 20, Kuwaiti officials responded that  Iraq wanted them to forgive war debts.
On July 24, the United States announced a "short- notice exercise" in the Persian Gulf and Kuwait went on alert.
Saddam Hussein then  summoned the U.S. ambassador for talks.
OPEC ministers then agreed to halt  overproduction and the two nations met to negotiate, although 100,000 Iraqi troops were  on the border.
Talks collapsed the next day and Iraq invaded at 2 a.m. on August 2.
