Iranian news media reacted quietly to Thursday=B9s earthquake that killed 25,000 people in northern Iran.
The country is accustomed to massive tragedies: a million Iranians were killed in the war with Iraq and hundreds of thousands of lives were lost when the Islamic revolution overthrew the Shah.
Moreover, an earthquake a dozen years earlier had also killed about 25,000.
Iranian media was quick to report the quake but follow-on reports mis-characterized the damage as falling mainly on crops.
Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani declared a three-day mourning period for quake victims but TV showed cartoons for children and a soccer match.
