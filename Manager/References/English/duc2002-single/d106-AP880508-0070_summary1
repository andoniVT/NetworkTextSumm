A campaign at Northeastern University to award an honorary degree to South African nationalist leader Nelson Mandela has been successful.
It was necessary to change a university policy, which barred honorary degrees for anyone who could not be present at the ceremony.
Mandela is imprisoned in South Africa and the white-minority government will free him only if he renounces the use of violence by forces seeking political power for blacks.
South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu will accept the degree for Mandela.
The only remaining hitch is getting Mandela family approval, which has not yet been received.
