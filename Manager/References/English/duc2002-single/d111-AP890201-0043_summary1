An Argentine supply ship, which also carried tourists, ran aground and sank off Antarctica.
Tourists and crew were evacuated from the Bahia Paraiso to Palmer Station, a US facility.
No injuries were reported.
Leaks from the ship killed some krill, a vital part of the food chain, and any further leaks would constitute an ecological disaster.
Argentine officials doubted further spilling since the ship's fuel and that being taken to the Argentine Esperanza station were in steel drums.
A cruise ship took the tourists to the South Shetland Islands, but 104 crewmen remained at the station, which is equipped for only 40 people.
