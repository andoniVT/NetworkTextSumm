Damage from Hurricane Hugo, which struck the Carolinas and the Caribbean last  week, will reduce third-quarter earnings for several insurers.
American International Group Inc., which insured property in Puerto Rico, the  Caribbean and the Carolinas, expects net losses related to Hugo to reduce pretax  earnings between $35 and 45 million.
St. Paul Cos., said the pretax cost of Hugo shouldn't exceed $50 million.
State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. estimates claim payments from Hugo  will exceed $400 million in South Carolina alone.
An insurance industry analyst said 35% to 45% of Cigna's $1.40-a-share third  quarter earnings estimate could be erased.
