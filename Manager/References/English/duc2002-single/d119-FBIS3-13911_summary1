The choice of heavyweight Wesley Egan as new US ambassador to Jordan signals  Jordan's importance to the US.
Egan was second in charge at the US Embassy in Cairo,  served in Saudi Arabia, two African countries, and in Europe.
In confirmation hearings,  he pledged to enhance Jordan's role in the peace process and attend to Jordanian stability,  human rights, compliance with sanctions against Iraq, termination of the boycott of  companies doing business with Israel, anti-terrorism efforts, and investment potential  in  Jordan.
During the hearing, Senator Moynihan's remarks mirrored an undeclared US  policy dictated by the Zionist lobby.
Moynihan stressed Jordan's lack of sovereignty over  the West Bank.
