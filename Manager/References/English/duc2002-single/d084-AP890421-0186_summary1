The USS Iowa steamed home from Puerto Rico on Friday with investigators on board  interviewing crewmen and reviewing a videotape of the explosion taken by an Iowa  officer who was recording the firing of the big guns.
Members of the Senate Armed Services Committee said Friday the panel will hold  hearings on the explosion which occurred during open seas gun practice 300 miles north  of Puerto Rico.
The Pentagon said the blast occurred in the middle gun of the three-gun turret.
It had not  yet been fired.
The Pentagon has ordered a moratorium on firings of the 16-inch guns.
