At least 47 crewmen died today in an explosion in one of three giant WWII-era gun  turrets on the battleship Iowa.
The Defense Department said the explosion possibly  resulted from the blast of a 110-pound gunpowder bag used to fires shells weighing over  a ton a distance of up to 23 miles.
The Iowa was commissioned in 1943 and most recently returned to service in December  1982.
It was on a training exercise about 330 miles northeast of Puerto Rico.
The Iowa was headed to Roosevelt Roads Naval Base in Puerto Rico and was in no  danger of sinking.
