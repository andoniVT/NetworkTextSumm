In a meeting Monday with West German government and industrial leaders, including  President Richard von Weizaecker, Philippine President Corazon Aquino asked for  economic assistance.
She said that though the Philippines' debt was projected to increase  to $29 billion by December, much of that was stolen by ousted dictator Marcos.
Calling  for debt relief and investment, Mrs. Aquino said that under her leadership the country's  growth rate had improved from minus10 percent to plus 6.7 percent.
During an evening  state banquet, Weizaecker assured Mrs. Aquino that the barrier-free market the European  Economic Community plans for 1992 will not prevent trade with other countries.
