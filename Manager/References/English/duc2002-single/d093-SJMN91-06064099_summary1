A boat carrying hundreds of Somali refugees struck a reef off Kenya and sank, killing  more than 130 people.
The ferry carried over 600 people.
Police, navy divers, tourists  and local residents recovered 130 bodies, but 50 victims were still believed trapped in the  sunken vessel.
It was one of many vessels that brought thousands of Somalis seeking  refuge to Kenya since rebels over threw the Somali president.
The fighting now appears  to have largely stopped, but refugees continue to arrive.
Most of those who drowned  were on the lower deck.
Earlier, 11 Somalis drowned when a boat capsized off the coast  of Kenya.
