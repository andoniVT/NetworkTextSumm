The 30-ton ferry Justo Rufino Barrios II, which sank off Guatemala's east coast Sunday,  was authorized to carry 90 passengers but had 120.
It ran out of fuel midway on a 16-mile  run across Amatique Bay from Livingston to Puerto Barrios.
The skipper of a patrol boat  towing it to port requested that 22-year-old ferry captain Juan Pablo Ezquibel take control  of the ferry's wheel, but Esquibel did so only when the boat began to capsize, after  passengers ran to one side when the boat leaned while riding a small wave.
Sixty-seven  people drowned and 14 are missing.
Esquibel was arrested for negligent homicide.
