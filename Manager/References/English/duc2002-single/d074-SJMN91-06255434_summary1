Virginia Thomas, the white wife of black Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas,  has represented the conservative viewpoint in the various positions she has held.
Women's-rights activists dislike her opposition to comparable-worth legislation, religious  groups are uncomfortable with her anti-cult activities, and some blacks feel the  Thomases' marriage shows his rejection of the black community.
Supporters reply that  the Thomases believe women and minorities are hindered, not helped, by affirmative  action and government programs and their marriage is a reflection of the couple's belief  in a colorblind society.
Clarence's Senate confirmation hearings began yesterday and  are likely to run through next week.
