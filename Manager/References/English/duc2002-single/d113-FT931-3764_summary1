More than a dozen bombs exploded in Bombay last night killing about 200 people and  injuring more than a thousand in India's commercial heart.
The attack was a severe  setback to India's attempts to recover from recent intercommunal violence sparked by  razing of a mosque at Ayodhya in northern India by Hindu zealots on December 6.
Ensuing riots killed more than 2,000 people, mostly Moslems, including 700 in Bombay.
Last night's targets included the Bombay Stock Exchange and the landmark Air India  building.
It was clearly aimed at the city's better-off business people whereas most of  the victims of the riots were poor.
