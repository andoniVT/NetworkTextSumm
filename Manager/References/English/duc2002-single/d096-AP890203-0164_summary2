In a White House reception on Friday, President Bush congratulated the San Francisco  49ers on their third Super Bowl title in eight years, saying they "rewrote the record  books."
Bush, in turn, was presented with autographed balls by quarterback Joe Montana  and wide receiver Jerry Rice, the game's Most Valuable Player.
Outgoing coach Bill  Walsh gave Bush a 49ers jogging outfit.
The 49ers beat the Cincinnati Bengals, 20-16, two weeks ago in Miami.
The winning  touchdown late in the fourth quarter was the culmination of a 92-yard drive by Montana.
Super Bowl winners are traditionally invited to the White House.
