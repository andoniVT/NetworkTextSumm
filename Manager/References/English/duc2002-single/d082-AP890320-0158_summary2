1975 Nobel Peace Prize winner Andrei D. Sakharov urged members of the Academy of  Sciences Monday to reject the leadership's slate for the new Soviet legislature in  Tuesday's voting.
The slate included old-guard managers of scientific institutions and not  the 67-year-old nuclear physicist and human rights activist, even though he was  nominated by 60 research institutes.
Many scientists object to the slate for Sunday's  election.
Sakharov was nominated for a seat in the new 2250-member Congress of  People's Deputies by several geographic districts, but refused the nominations and fought  for an Academy of Sciences seat.
Sakharov supporters hope to deny all nominees a  majority and force new nominations.
