Five explosions rocked Mount Pinatubo today between 08:40 a.m. and 11:05 p.m.  causing residents of nearby Angeles and the remaining personnel on Clark AFB to flee  the area.
Most of Clark's 15,000 residents were relocated to Subic Bay naval base on  Monday.
About 19,000 Filipinos have also departed provinces near the volcano, and  officials said more would be evacuated after today's eruptions.
The first fatality related to  the eruption occurred today when a car collided with a bus on an ash-slick road.
Seismologists said that more severe eruptions could come later.
President Aquino briefly  visited refugee centers near Angeles.
