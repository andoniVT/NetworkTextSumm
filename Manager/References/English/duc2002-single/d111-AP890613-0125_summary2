The Ostwind, an 85-foot yacht built for Hitler, was sunk on 4 June 1989.
The sinking was  arranged to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the United States' action in refusing to  allow the landing of the SS St. Louis with its 900 Jewish passengers seeking refuge.
The  organizers botched up the operation.
The yacht was sunk a mile from the intended site.
It  settled on a living reed in a shallow shipping lane.
The government ordered it cut up or  moved.
Hitler very seldom used the Ostwind.
The badly decayed yacht ended up in a Jacksonville  marina.
