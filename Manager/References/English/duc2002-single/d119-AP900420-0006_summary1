President Bush is expected to name a female ambassador to Nicaragua in view of  the  election of president Violeta Chamorro.
Front runner is Melissa Wells, 57, currently  ambassador to Mozambique.
Wells was born in Estonia, has no prior experience in Latin  America, but speaks Spanish.
The US and Nicaragua have not had ambassadors in each  other's capitals since July 1988, when the Sandinista government expelled US diplomats  on charges of interfering in Nicaragua's internal affairs.
Wells' 1986 nomination as  ambassador to Mozambique was held up for 11 months by Senator Jesse Helms, who  wanted to pressure the administration into dealing with rightist guerrillas opposed to  Mozambique's Marxist government.
