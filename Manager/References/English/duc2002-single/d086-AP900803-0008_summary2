Iraq's occupation of Kuwait yesterday has ended two weeks of tension and  negotiations.
First, Saddam Hussein accused Kuwait of flooding the oil market and of  stealing oil from wells along the disputed border.
Tension increased July 24-25 as the  U.S. announced a "short-notice exercise" in the Persian Gulf, Kuwait declared a state of  alert, and Iraq defied U.S. pressure.
Tension eased somewhat when Iraq and Kuwait  agreed to meet for discussions, but when they met on July 31 Iraq massed 100,000  troops on the border facing Kuwait's 20,000-strong armed forces.
The next day Iraq  pulled out of the peace talks and yesterday invaded, quickly occupying Kuwait.
