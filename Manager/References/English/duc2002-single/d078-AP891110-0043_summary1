Oscar, one of the most recognizable images in the entertainment industry, has no  copyright protection, a federal judge has ruled.
The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and  Sciences had sued Creative House Promotions (Chicago), manufacturer of an employee- incentive award that the judge acknowledged was "very similar" to the Oscar.
U.S. District Court Judge Laughlin Water rejected the academy's legal claims, saying  that the statuette was in the public domain prior to Jan. 1, 1978, the effective date of the  Copyright Act of 1976.
The first Oscars and all those distributed until about 1941 did not bear a mark  indicating copyright.
