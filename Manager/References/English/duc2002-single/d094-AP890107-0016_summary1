Emperor Hirohito will be remembered for one overwhelming decision during his 62-year  reign.
Japan must surrender for the first time in its history and end World War II.
Hirohito, who became emperor in 1926 at the age of 25, is generally portrayed as having  played no significant role in Japan's military adventures in the 30's and 40's.
In 1945,  after the U.S. dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Hirohito spoke out  against continuing the war and in a radio address to the nation announced Japan's  surrender.
After the war, the emperor was mainly a figurehead, but the imperial system  has remained important to Japanese.
