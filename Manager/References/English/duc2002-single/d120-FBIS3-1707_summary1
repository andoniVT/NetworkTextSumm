In a welcome to British Prime Minister John Major today at the Pittsburgh airport,  President Clinton said the two nations were working together to end the conflict in  Bosnia.
Major, after visiting Pittsburgh where his father and grandfather once lived, will  travel with the President back to Washington on Air Force One.
On Tuesday, the two  leaders will begin discussing a wide range of issues including Russia, Bosnia, Northern  Ireland, and world trade.
Clinton and Major will meet again in June during D-Day 50th anniversary events in  Europe.
Major said Clinton would visit Britain, including possibly Oxford University,  Clinton's alma mater.
