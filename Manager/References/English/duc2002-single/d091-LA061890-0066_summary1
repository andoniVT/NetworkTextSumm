The death toll from flash flooding in creeks in eastern Ohio reached 19 Sunday.
Workers used picks and shovels to dig along creek banks where dogs had detected human scent.
Twenty-three dog teams from four states searched for victims.
Often, cars are found buried in the brush and tree piles and they had to be torn apart and searched separately.
The flood destroyed as many as 70 houses and damaged 40 others.
Officials learned that some of those feared missing had moved out of the area but that still left 18 listed as missing.
