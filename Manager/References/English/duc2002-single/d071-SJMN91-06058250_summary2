William Wegman's two Weimaraners serve as both companions and artist models to the  artist.
The breed is affectionate and can hold a pose.
The mother-daughter dogs live with  Wegman in his home, a former Orthodox synagogue on Manhattan's Lower East Side.
The 47-year-old artist began his association with Weimaraners in 1970 when he acquired  a puppy, Man Ray, for $35 dollars.
He quickly learned that the breed makes perfect  subjects.
When he died at the age of 11, Man Ray was world famous.
One of Wegman's  current dogs, Fay Ray, is now a familiar face both with artists and among children who  watch Sesame Street.
