The winner of the Booker Prize for 1944 will be announced on 11 October.

It is a publishing gimmick, but it is also a fascinating exercise in  historical reconstruction.
The short-list is a sensation.
It includes such classics as Kilpling's "Jungle Book", George  du Maurier's "Trilby", and Anthony Hope's "The Prisoner of Zenda".
All the 1894  Booker writers were popular names but also serious skillful writers whose books can be  read with pleasure 100 years later.
