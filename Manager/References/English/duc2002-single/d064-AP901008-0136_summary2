McDonald's opened their first restaurant in China on Monday the in city of Shenzhen.
China has long been known for its cuisine but most Chinese workers, who average  $32.00 a month, are unable to afford fancy restaurants.
Even the higher wages of  Shenzhen, where workers average $53.00 a month, the $1.14 cost of the Big Mac along  with 48 cents for fries and 74 cents for a shake may cause the Chinese to view eating at  McDonald's as a treat rather than a convenience.
Such is the case with Kentucky Fried  Chicken, which opened its first restaurant in Peking three years ago.
While popular, the  Chinese still consider eating there a treat.
