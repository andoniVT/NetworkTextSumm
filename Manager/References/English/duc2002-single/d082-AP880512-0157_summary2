Andrei D. Sakharov, brilliant physicist and prominent 1970s dissident, won the 1975  Nobel Peace Prize.
After criticizing Soviet intervention in Afghanistan, without trial he  was exiled to the closed city of Gorky from January 1980 to December 1986.
Sakharov,  66, and his wife live frugally in their two-room, seventh-floor Moscow apartment, a  mecca for people seeking aid.
Sakharov supports Gorbachev's reform program but wants  speedier progress in human rights and a nuclear testing ban.
On January 15th he listed  200 political prisoners.
Sakharov's 1975 statement of his views was not published  domestically.
Media which once branded him a traitor now tries to undo harm.
