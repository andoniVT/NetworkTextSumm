An overcrowded ferry sank Wednesday night where the Ilisha, Tetulia, and Meghna  Rivers meet in southern Bangladesh.
It went out of control while turning, in 22 feet of  water.
The ferry carried double its authorized capacity of 100.
People on the roof swam  to safety but 100 drowned, including most of those in the hull.
Another ferry on the  Meghna River, the M.V.
Sagar, was attacked by river pirates Tuesday near Chandpur.
Fifty pirates boarded as passengers, and shortly before midnight fired rifles and hurled  homemade bombs.
Two hundred passengers were wounded and six thrown overboard.
The pirates took $83,000 and escaped in waiting boats.
