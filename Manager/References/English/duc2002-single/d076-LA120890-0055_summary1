Queen Elizabeth awarded former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher the Order of Merit  on Friday.
The award follows quickly on the heels of Mrs. Thatcher's resignation as  prime minister.
The quickness of the award suggests that the Queen wished to show that  there was no animosity between the two women.
At the same time, Mrs. Thatcher's  husband, Denis, was awarded the hereditary knighthood of baronet.
He will be formally  addressed as Sir Denis and his wife as Lady Thatcher, although she insists she wishes to  be known simply as Mrs. Thatcher.
The Order of Merit, created in 1902, is restricted to  only 24 men and women.
