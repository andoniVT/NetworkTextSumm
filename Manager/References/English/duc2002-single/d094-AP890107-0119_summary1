World leaders sent Japan messages of condolences after Emperor Hirohito's death, but  painful memories of World War II still generated criticism of the Japanese monarch.
President Reagan and the president of the Soviet Union sent condolences but in South  Korea and Taiwan reaction was cool.
Both countries suffered under the Japanese military  during World War II.
Most historians believe that Hirohito was a powerless figurehead  but had to approve orders to attack Pearl Harbor and the invasion of Asian countries.
He  called on his nation to surrender in 1945.
As one man said, "Only now has World War II  finally come to an end."
