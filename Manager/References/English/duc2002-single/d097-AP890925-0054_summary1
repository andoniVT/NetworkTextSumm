Charleston Mayor Joseph Riley attributed the low number of fatalities from  Hurricane Hugo to residents who monitored the strength of the hurricane and  heeded evacuation warnings.
The storm, which caused billions in damage, claimed  17 lives in South Carolina, only two of which were in the Charleston area where  Hugo's 135 mph winds were most prevalent.
In the last decade several big storms have veered away from South Carolina, and  officials feared that the latest warnings wouldn't be heeded.
Instead, tens of  thousands in Charleston and the three surrounding counties went to shelters or  evacuated inland.
