Moslem militants armed with AK-47 rifles killed two unarmed paramilitary soldiers on Thursday.
This brings to 81 the number killed since January 20th in clashes between security forces and Moslem militants fighting for independence from India.
Police officials said that militants had also exploded bombs in a government building and a bank and had set a fire in a shopping center.
Kashmir militants had earlier campaigned to join Pakistan because of its predominately Moslem population but now they wish independence and status as a neutral country.
Sixty-four percent of the population of Jammu-Kashmir, India's only predominantly Moslem state are Moslems.
