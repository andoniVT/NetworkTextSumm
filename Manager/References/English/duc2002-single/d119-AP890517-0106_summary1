Today the Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted 13-0 to endorse the nomination of  Michigan Republican activist Peter F. Secchia as ambassador to Italy.
Chairman  Claiborne Pell abstained, saying the nomination was a mistake.
He feared Secchiai'  penchant for making gross remarks might embarrass the US.
Tact and careful speech  were hallmarks of successful diplomats and Secchia's qualities were opposite those.
But   since Secchia was the president's choice, he wouldn't try to block or delay the  nomination.
Secchia pledged to be more careful in his use of colorful language as a  diplomat.
Secchia is a former Republican national committeeman and lumber industry  executive.
