Seven jurors in the McMartin Pre-School molestation case talked with reporters after  their acquittal of Raymond Buckey and his mother on Thursday.
The jurors faulted the  videotaped interviews with the children, saying the interviewers asked leading questions  so the children could not tell their own story.
The jurors also criticized a letter sent to  parents by police after the first accusation, saying the letter put information out too early  and led parents.
The jurors said even if some of the children had been molested, it was  not proven that it happened at the school.
The trial took an enormous toll on everyone.
