The exact number of people killed during the martial law occupation of Beijing may  never be known.
One government statement says that 300 soldiers, "thugs," bystanders  and students have been killed.
Another says that 400 missing soldiers may be dead or  wounded.
Unofficial estimates of the death toll range from 500 to 12,000 people.
Officials of the Chinese Red Cross estimated 2,600 killed while one Hong Kong  newspaper said that 5,000 were killed and 30,000 injured.
Nearly all of the deaths and  injuries occurred Saturday night and early Sunday when troops fired randomly into large  crowds while forcing their way to Tiananmen Square.
