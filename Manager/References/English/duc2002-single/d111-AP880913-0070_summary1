A Finnish-registered freighter with a cargo of beer sank in high winds in the North Sea.
The sinking occurred off the Dutch coast near the island of Ameland.
A West German helicopter rescued the crew members from their life rafts.
All nine were safe.
The ship's departure point and destination were not known.
The Dutch Navy also responded to the scene, sending a plane and two lifeboats.
Early reports had said the ship was a passenger ferry, possibly Dutch.
Ferries and cargo ships frequent the shipping lanes between the coastal islands and the Dutch mainland.
