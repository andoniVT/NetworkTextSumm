An Arab League Council meeting of foreign ministers was convened in Cairo at Kuwait's  request.
The Council failed to publicly condemn Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
So far, only  Lebanon's prime minister and foreign minister, Salim Hoss, has joined Kuwait to  publicly condemn this invasion--the first time in modern history one Arab country  invaded another to take control of the government.
Iraq claims it entered Kuwait at the  request of a Kuwaiti revolutionary group that had overthrown the government.
Kuwait  has invoked the 1950 Arab joint defense pact, which requires pact members "to repel  [invader] aggression and restore security and peace."
