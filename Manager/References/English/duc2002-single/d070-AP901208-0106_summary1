A newspaper has reported one of the first issues facing Bonn and Moscow since they signed  several treaties designed to draw the two nations closer together.
Germany has demanded the  Soviets hand over Erich Honecker, who is wanted by German authorities on manslaughter  charges.
A federal lawmaker said refusal to turn him over for trial could "burden" Bonn and  Moscow's "outstanding relations."
A Berlin court has issued an arrest warrant for Honecker accusing him of issuing shoot-to-kill  orders to East German guards.
Honecker is in a Soviet hospital near Berlin.
Soviet officials say  German police need Soviet permission to enter.
