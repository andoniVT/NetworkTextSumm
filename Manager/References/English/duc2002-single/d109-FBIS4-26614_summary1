Yesterday, Hunan Province officials, Party Committee Secretary Maolin, Governor Chen  Bangzhu and others, traveled to Changshayan to survey the flooding around Changsha.
Interviewed here in Changshayan, Governor Chen said that the flooding is the worst seen  in 100 years, but because of the efforts of soldiers and the people, some of the key dams  are still sound and economic losses are minimal.
He thanked the people, but noted that  more rain is expected.
He was confident, however, that under the leadership of the CPC  Central Committee and the State Council, the soldiers and people would overcome  hardships.
