Four more bodies were found Sunday (one in Pipe Creek about seven miles south of  Shadyside, one along Wegee Creek, and two in the Ohio River), bringing the death toll  from flash floods that swept through eastern Ohio on Thursday to 20.
Sixteen people are  still missing.
National Guard Capt.
Jim Boling said 23 dog teams were searching for  victims.
The Wegee and Pipe creeks overflowed when 5 inches of rain fell in 3 hours.
Shadyside  Fire Chief Mark Badia said rainwater running down hillsides forced debris into the  creeks, forming dams at bridges.
The "dams" broke under the water pressure.
