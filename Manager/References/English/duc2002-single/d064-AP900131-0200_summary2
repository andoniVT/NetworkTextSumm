The world's largest McDonald's served 30,00 customers on its opening day in Moscow,  breaking the opening day record for McDonald's worldwide.
A crush of people lined up  before dawn outside the 700 seat restaurant.
To accommodate the crowds, McDonald's  stayed open two hours past its closing time.
The Big Mac, priced at 3.75 rubles, costs  about two hours pay for the average Russian worker.
Even so, McDonald's is still much  cheaper that other private restaurants in Moscow.
The Soviets got their first look at  friendly and efficient service and, for most Russians, their first experience with a  hamburger.
To guarantee its supplies, McDonald's built its own factory, including a  bakery, dairy, and meat processing plant; important in a country where up to 25 percent  of the harvest rots en route to the customer.
