Communism's first taste of a Big Mac occurred with the opening of a McDonald's in  Belgrade, Yugoslavia.
The opening of the first of six McDonald's in Yugoslavia in the  next five years drew large crowds.
Many stood in line for up to three hours to get their  first taste of an American hamburger.
The opening may be the beginning of a competition  between the Big Mac and Yugoslavia's traditional hamburger-like fast food, the  Pljeskavica.
Priced about the same as the Pljeskavica, the Big Mac will be offered in a  setting that discourages lounging, bans smoking and is alcohol free; a sharp contrast to  traditional Balkan dining custom.
