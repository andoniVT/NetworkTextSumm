Four imprisoned African National Congress leaders, convicted in 1964 with Nelson  Mandela, were allowed to visit him at his isolated prison house.
The four men all  imprisoned in Cape Town, spent 6 hours with Mandela, who was nearby.
Mandela was  moved to the house from prison after recovering from tuberculosis at a Cape Town clinic.
His wife, Minnie Mandela, charges is practically in solitary confinement.
The men     convicted along with Mandela and three others were all given life sentences for their  activities with the ANC in attempting to overthrow the white-led government.
