Releasing a heart attack victim from the hospital as soon as three days after their attack  are becoming more common with new medical treatments.
The early discharges are made  possible with the introduction of tissue plasminogen activator, or TPA, and balloon  angioplasty.
TPA, given right after a heart attack, can dissolve clots while angioplasty  can open up clogged arteries.
Patients sent home early can return to work earlier that  those kept longer, while the number of medical problems suffered by both groups after  six months were similar.
The earlier release also has the benefit of significantly reducing  medical costs.
