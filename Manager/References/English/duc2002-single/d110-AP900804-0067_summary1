Saudi Arabia will not close the pipeline that carries Iraqi oil for export across Saudi  Arabia to the Red Sea.
They feel this might provoke Saddam Hussein into occupying  Saudi oil fields 150 miles south of Kuwait, thus giving him control of more oil than any  country in the world.
The Saudis sheltered the Kuwaiti ruling family and allowed them  to operate a radio, which soon went off the air.
It is unknown if it was shut down by the  Iraqis or the Saudis.
Saudi Arabia joined other Arab organizations to condemn the  invasion.
Turkey also would not cut its Iraqi used pipeline.
