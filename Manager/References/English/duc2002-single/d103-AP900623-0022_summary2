Shahin Gobadi, spokesman for the People's Mojahedin of Iran, claims that the Islamic  Republic of Iran is purposely underreporting the number of casualties from Thursday's  massive earthquake (7.3-7.7 on the Richter scale) out of a fear of political backlash.
Speaking before a rally today across the street from the White House in Washington,  Gobadi claimed that while Iran has reported 36,000 dead, he has received estimates  closer to 100,000.
The government is unable to properly assist earthquake victims, he  said, because it "has devoted all of its resources to a senseless war with Iraq and to  oppression of the people at home."
