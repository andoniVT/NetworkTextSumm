Philippine President Corazon Aquino has agreed to allow Ferdinand Marcos to return so  that he can be prosecuted for stealing billions of dollars.
Manila newspapers reported  today, that she told this to lawyers in Switzerland when she visited there.
She has refused  to allow Marcos, in exile in Hawaii, back into the Philippines, citing security reasons.
He  was ousted in a 1986 coup and is accused of stealing $10 billion, much of it allegedly  deposited in Swiss bank accounts.
Although the Swiss government has frozen these  funds, Swiss law allows secrecy requirements to be lifted only for a criminal prosecution.
