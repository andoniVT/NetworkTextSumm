Discovery astronauts launched the $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope on its 97.3- minute, 380-mile-high orbit around Earth at 12:38pm PDT today, one orbit late.
Steve  Hawley began the slow process of grasping the 12.5-ton Hubble with Discovery's 50-foot  mechanical arm shortly after 4am PDT.
First he had to disconnect Hubble from the  shuttle's power and switch it to batteries.
The first solar array unreeled properly.
The  starboard panel first refused to budge, then moved a fifth of its 39-foot length.
Commands from Earth finally freed it.
Sun power flowing into the telescope's batteries  through solar panels relieved worries that the batteries would use up their eight-hour  charge.
