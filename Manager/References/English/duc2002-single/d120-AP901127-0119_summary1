John Major, 47, Margaret Thatcher's protege, was elected Conservative Party leader  Tuesday night and will succeed her as prime minister.
Mrs. Thatcher, ending 11 years in power, intended to submit her resignation to Queen  Elizabeth II on Wednesday.
Major would then be called to lead the government.
His election climaxed a tumultuous month for the Conservative Party.
The party trailed  the Labor Party in the polls and lost a string of local Parliamentary elections.
On Nov. 1,  Deputy Prime Minister, Sir Geoffrey Howe resigned in a policy dispute over the  European Community, calling Mrs. Thatcher a threat to Britain's vital interests.
