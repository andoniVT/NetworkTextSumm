More than 5,000 people packed a Chinatown park in New York City Saturday morning  for a memorial service honoring the demonstrators killed last weekend in Tiananmen  Square.
The crowd wave banners and wore buttons honoring "the martyrs of Tiananmen  Square".
After the service and speeches, the crowd, led by a casket and Chinese funeral  bier, marched through Chinatown in a procession that stretched for blocks.
One of the  speakers said the violent suppression of the democratic reformers had united Chinese  everywhere.
Demonstrators planned another rally later Saturday outside the United Nations building.
