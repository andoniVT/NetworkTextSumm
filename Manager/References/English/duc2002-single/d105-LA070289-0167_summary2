President Gorbachev warned Saturday that growing ethnic unrest across the Soviet Union  was endangering the political and economic reforms, and even threatening the nation's  existence.
He acknowledged that the early Soviet effort to pull the 100-plus ethnic groups  into a unified culture was a cause of the present strife.
Last month troops were sent to Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia to maintain order.
Groups in Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania are advocating secession.
One hundred died last  month in vicious assaults against Mesketian Turks in Uzbekistan, and there is new  violence in an area of Georgia populated be Azerbaijanis.
