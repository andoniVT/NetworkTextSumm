Iraqi President Saddam Hussein saw the invasion of Kuwait as an opportunity to solve his  financial problems and fulfill his territorial ambitions.
Iraq's eight-year war with Iran left  Iraq with a 70 billion dollar debt that was a drag on the economy.
Saddam was incensed  that Kuwait demanded repayment of wartime loans.
Hussein also accused Kuwait of  stealing 2.4 billion dollars worth of oil from a disputed border area, and costing Iraq oil  revenue by ignoring production quotas established by OPEC.
By controlling Kuwait, Iraq  could also fulfill its longstanding wish to for more gulf coastline.
