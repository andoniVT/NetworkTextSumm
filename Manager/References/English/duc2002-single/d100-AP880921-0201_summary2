Celebrity biographer Albert Goldman had a mythic view of "Lennon the Great" when he began his book The Lives of John Lennon.
He called Lennon's widow Yoko Ono for assistance, but she never responded.
Goldman says his view of Lennon changed after 1,200 interviews uncovered the worst regarding Lennon.
He claimed that Lennon stayed in bed for days at a time, was bisexual, a drug abuser, anorexic, reclusive, and had wild drinking binges.
Goldman had also written tell-all biographies of Elvis Presley and Lenny Bruce.
Goldman said his books were bad for Yoko business and for Paul McCartney's business.
