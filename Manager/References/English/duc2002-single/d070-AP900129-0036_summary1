Ousted East German leader Erich Honecker, who is expected to be indicted for high treason, was  arrested Monday following his release from a hospital where he had undergone kidney tumor  surgery.
He joins other ousted Politburo members already in prison awaiting trial.
Honecker and  former State Security Chief Erick Mielke would be charged with treason and corruption for  misuse of their positions and State funds.
Honecker has been declared too ill to withstand imprisonment.
It is not known if the prison  where he is held has a medical facility.
East Germany's Lutheran Church has offered to place  him in a home for the aged.
