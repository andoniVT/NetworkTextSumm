Jurors in the McMartin pre-school trial remained deadlocked on 13 of the charges  brought against Raymond Buckey and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buskey.
The  decisions on the 52 charges in which they have reached a verdict will remain sealed until  a decision is reached on how to proceed on the deadlocked charges.
Jurors were confused  on some points of law in the deadlocked charges, especially on how to reach a verdict on  the charge of conspiring between the two defendants; failing to see how they could find  one, but not both, innocent of the charge.
Jurors are in their ninth week of deliberation.
