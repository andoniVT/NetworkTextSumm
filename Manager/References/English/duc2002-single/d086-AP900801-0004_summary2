Iraqi troops launched an offensive against Kuwait at midnight Wednesday.
Two weeks  ago Iraq moved 100,000 troops to its border with Kuwait, accusing the smaller country  of violating OPEC oil quotas and stealing oil from a field on the border.
Earlier  Wednesday Iraqi officials had walked out of diplomatic talks in Jiddah, Saudi Arabia.
In  Washington the State Department advised the Iraqi ambassador of the U.S. desire for a  peaceful solution to the tensions.
The United States has no treaty obligations to Kuwait  but does have six warships in the area that have been conducting exercises with the  forces of the United Arab Emirates, some 700 miles southeast of Kuwait.
