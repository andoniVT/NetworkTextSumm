The late Robert Maxwell was a strong supporter of chess and a chess set was always set up in his  office.
Malcolm Pein, master chess player and director of chess and bridge, told of Maxwell's  support of the game when he sponsored a section of the World Chess championships in New  York.
Maxwell kept the chess and bridge publishing businesses when Pergamon sold to Elsevier  last year.
Although it has taken a year to separate Chess Monthly and Bridge Monthly from the  Maxwell empire, Chess and Bridge has not moved to new premises in London.
