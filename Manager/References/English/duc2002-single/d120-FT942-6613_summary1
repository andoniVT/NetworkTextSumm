A biography of Mrs. Norma Major claims that the Majors' favorite film was "Being  There," a movie about a vacuous gardener, Chauncey, who becomes a candidate for the  U.S. presidency.
I heartily concur with their choice.
John Major must appreciate the  similarities between himself and Chauncey.
Like Chauncey whose bromides seem to  convey whatever people want to believe they heard, Major is a chameleon.
For the pro- Europeans, he says he wants Britain to be at the heart of Europe, but before an audience  of Euro-sceptics he freely insults the European Commission.
He fits in with prevailing  circumstances, no matter how fluctuating.
