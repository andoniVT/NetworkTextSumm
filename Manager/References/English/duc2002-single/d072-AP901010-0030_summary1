Conductor Leonard Bernstein is giving up performing because of poor health.
The 72- year-old, a former heavy smoker, suffers from a variety of lung disorders and has had  increasing difficulty in breathing.
He plans to participate in the October 28 AIDS benefit,  but cancelled all other appearances.
He intends to continue composing, writing, and  recording.
Bernstein's announcement dismayed the music world, especially at the New  York Philharmonic which he conducted 1,244 times and is designated the laureate  conductor for life.
He is known for his vigorous style and adventurous concerts.
Bernstein, a successful composer, was the first American conductor respected throughout  the world.
