A representative of the African National Congress said the South African government  would soon release Nelson Mandela from prison.
Mandela, 70, was jailed for life 27  years ago for conspiring to overthrow the government of South Africa.
He was recently  transferred from prison to hospital for treatment of tuberculosis.
The ANC is fighting to  end white-minority rule in South Africa.
The release may be an attempt to win  international support for the South African government.
A South African government  source indicated the rumors of Mandela's release were orchestrated by the anti-apartheid  movement to pressure the government.
Apartheid is South Africa's policy of racial  separation.
