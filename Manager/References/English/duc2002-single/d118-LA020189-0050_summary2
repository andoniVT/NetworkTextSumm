The first controversy surrounding a Bush cabinet nominee has erupted during the confirmation  hearings of former Senator John Tower as Secretary of Defense.
In testimony before the Senate  Armed Services Committee, Paul Weyrich told the committee that Tower may lack the moral  fiber for the position, citing inappropriate use of alcohol and questionable associations with  women.
Criticism from Weyrich and other witnesses has caused some committee members to  rethink their position on the nomination.
Committee chairman Sam Nunn, of the other hand  commented that there has been a surplus of rumor and a shortage of personal knowledge.
