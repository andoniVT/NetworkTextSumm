Erich Honecker, the former GDR head of state, died at his house in Santiago, Chile on Sunday  morning May 29, 1994.
His lawyer, who represented the 81-year old Honecker before the Berlin  court in 1992 and early 1993, said Honecker rejected an operation but could not comment on the  exact cause of Honecker's death.
A colleague said earlier that he had obviously died from his  liver cancer.
After release from prison in 1993, Honecker traveled to Santiago to join his daughter who is  married to a Chilean.
He and his wife had been living in a wealthy Santiago area.
