A great quake hit southern California in 1857 and an 8.3 quake hit San Francisco in 1906,  killing 2500.
The same size quake takes longer to happen again because quakes relieve   stress, so scientists believed the next big one would strike the LA area.
In 1985 Geologist  Christopher Scholz predicted a 6.9 quake any time in a northern portion of the San  Andreas Fault, believing the 1906 quake relieved less stress than thought.
A 1988 US  Geological Survey report predicted a 20% likelihood of a 7 quake there within 30 years,  and a 30% chance of a 6.5 quake in the area where Tuesday's 6.9 quake was centered.
