The late Jesse Owens, hero of the 1936 Berlin Olympics where he exploded the Hitler myth of Aryan superiority, was honored at a White House ceremony when President Bush presented the Congressional Gold Medal to his widow, Ruth Owens.
Bush cited Owens' four gold medals at the Berlin Games as "a victory for humanity".
Bush, borrowing a phrase from Ruth Owens, said it was not the athletic feats but "his humanitarian contributions in the race of life" that earned the medal for Owens.
Owens' name lives on through many activities and a foundation that awards scholarships to needy youth.
