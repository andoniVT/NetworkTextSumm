Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto further raised tensions by accusing India on  Thursday of conducting genocide in Kashmir, killing Islamic scholars and citizens.
She  was referring to the recent assassination of a top Moslem cleric and the killing of 58  people during his funeral procession.
Ms. Bhutto had just returned from a mission to  Islamic nations in the Middle East and North Africa.
She claims full support from these  nations against Hindu-dominated India.
Pakistan and India already have fought two wars  over Kashmir.
Since India began a crackdown against Moslem separatists in January,  more than 400 people have been killed.
