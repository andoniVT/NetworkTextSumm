The shuttle Discovery is to lift off from Kennedy Space Center at 8:31am EDT Tuesday  with five astronauts and the $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope.
A faulty power unit   forced cancellation of an April 10th launch.
NASA must launch Discovery by Saturday  or wait eight days to recharge Hubble's batteries.
Later, shuttle Columbia will take up  astronomical observatory Astro to measure ultraviolet radiation and provide Hubble with  additional targets.
Hubble and Astro launches were scheduled for 1986 but delayed by the  Challenger accident.
Discovery will aim for an altitude of 380 miles, the highest a shuttle  has ever gone, to place Hubble in orbit above Earth's distorting atmosphere.
