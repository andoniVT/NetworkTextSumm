The Korean-flagged fishing vessel Chin Yuan Hsing was scuttled in waters off Argentina  on 21 May 1994.
Adverse weather conditions prevailed when the Argentine corvette  Spiro spotted the Korean ship fishing illegally in restricted Argentine waters.
The Korean  vessel did not respond to the corvette's warning.
Instead, the Korean crew sank their ship,  and transferred to another Korean ship sailing nearby.
In accordance with a UK-Argentine agreement, the Argentine Navy turned the  surveillance of the second Korean vessel over to the British when it approached within 15  nautical miles of the Malvinas (Falkland) Islands.
