Soviet President Gorbachev on Tuesday said that one Germany was likely in the future,  and added, referring to the growing number of demonstrations in East Germany, that  Germans "should not decide this important question in the street".
This was his most  tolerant statement yet on reunification, something the Soviets have opposed for more than  40 years.
Erich Honeker, the hard-line leader of the East German Communist Party, was removed  from office last October, and is awaiting trial for treason and abuse of power.
The  Communist Party faces an uphill battle in the March 18 parliamentary elections.
