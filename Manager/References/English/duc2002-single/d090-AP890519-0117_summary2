Friday, President Corazon Aquino refused to allow Ferdinand Marcos to return to the  Philippines to die or permit his body to be buried here.
Marcos is in critical condition in  Honolulu.
His wife, Imelda, broadcast an appeal to allow his return and said she was  trying to contact the president.
The president's daughter denied receiving any calls.
Aquino, whose government has survived six coup attempts, cited security reasons, but  said she was praying for Marcos' recovery.
Marcos' supporters are planning a rally for  Saturday and warned of demonstrations if he should die in exile.
The Philippine military  said law and order will prevail.
