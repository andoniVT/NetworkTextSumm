A 7.7 magnitude earthquake struck northern Iran.
It is the largest quake ever recorded in  that area, striking an area where most buildings are built on a flood plain of loosely  deposited soil.
The soil shifts in an earthquake which caused the fragile ceramic-type  brick or adobe homes to collapse easily.
The casualty count was pushed up because the  quake struck just after midnight, when people were indoors asleep.
Thursday's quake was  reminiscent of the Dec. 7, 1988 quake which devastated Soviet Armenia.
That quake,  which measured 6.9 on the Richter scale, killed about 25,000 people.
Most died in  structures that collapsed.
