Beatle fans in Moscow joined a worldwide celebration and tribute for the late John Lennon who would have turned 50 this week.
The state television program "Vremya" reported on the event and even called Lennon's "Imagine" an "anthem of peace".
The Beatle's music had been suppressed during the Soviet era.
A thousand fans flocked to a hall to rejoice in Lennon's music.
A plaque outside commemorated speeches given there many years earlier by Lennon's near namesake, Vladimir Lenin, founder of the Soviet Union.
The secretary of a Moscow Beatle's fan club said that Lennon's music crosses borders easily.
