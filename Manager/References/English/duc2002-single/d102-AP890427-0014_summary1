Lucille Ball never knew how great she was.
She never bragged or exercised her  considerable power.
When she was praised for "I Love Lucy" she always diverted credit  to her husband, the writers, and the co-stars.
While the writing, cast and production were  marvelous, Lucy's performance added the quantum force.
In an interview late in life, she  revealed an ambivalence to the show, primarily because her marriage was ending.
She  did not reach her comedy potential until she was 40 and started on television.
She  declared TV was the medium for her and anyone else who wanted quick success.
