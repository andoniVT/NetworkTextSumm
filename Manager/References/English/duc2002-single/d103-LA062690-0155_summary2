Salman Rushdie, who was sentenced to death by the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini,  donated $8,600 to victims of last week's devastating earthquake in Iran.
Rushdie, in  hiding because of the Iranian leadership's threat to his life, declared, "It's quite clear  that at the moment, we should be thinking only of the humanitarian issue, which  transcends all other discussion."
In Tehran Ayatollah Sadeq Khalkhali, known as the  "Hanging Judge," said "The foreign media seems to think that by publishing news of aid  from Salman Rushdie to earthquake victims, we will compromise on Rushdie's fatwa  (edict)."
He indicated that they would not.
