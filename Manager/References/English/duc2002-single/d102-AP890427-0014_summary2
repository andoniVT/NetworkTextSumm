Lucille Ball was unusual in the entertainment world in that she never bragged, never  exercised her considerable power and seemed astonished when honors came her way.
She always credited others for the success she achieved.
Miss Ball was late in reaching  her comedy potential.
She was 40 when she starred in "I Love Lucy" which was to  revolutionize television.
She rarely indulged in self-analysis, although she did say that  she was ambivalent about the last 5 years of the show.
Her husband and costar Desi  Arnaz was drinking and carousing and it was a terrible embarrassment for her.
