This morning Provincial Party Committee Secretary Wang Molin, provincial Governor  Chen Bangzhu, and other party and government leaders arrived at Changsha City to  direct the fight against the flooding.
Governor Chen Bangzhu said in an interview that  this flood in Hunan province is of a severity unseen for the past 100 years in terms of  both water level and quantity.
He said that efforts by Army personnel and the people  have protected key dams, thereby keeping economic losses to a minimum.
However, the  province's situation remains serious because forecasts indicate more rain will fall over  the next several days.
