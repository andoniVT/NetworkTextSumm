Huntington, Indiana, the home town of VP Dan Quayle is celebrating his life with the "Premiere Dan Quayle Memorabilia Exhibit".
Relatives, classmates, and neighbors have donated many items that are in some way associated with the vice president.
The exhibit was put together by the Dan Quayle Commemorative Foundation.
The group believes that Quayle, who could not attend because of a busy schedule, deserves the tribute.
They are also quick to defend their favorite son but don't expect him to receive much "good press".
"We want everyone to know that he is a winner, I don't care what the newspapers say" said one of the exhibit organizers.
