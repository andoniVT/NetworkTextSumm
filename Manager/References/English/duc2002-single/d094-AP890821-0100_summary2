Emperor Hirohito left $13.06 million in taxable property the Kojimachi Tax Office near  the Imperial Palace announced Monday.
I t was the first time that tax authorities have  disclosed the amount of an emperor's taxable estate, an official said.
Until the end of  WW II, emperors were regarded as living gods.
Hirohito died of cancer on Jan. 7 at age 87.
He was succeeded by Akihito, his eldest son.
Three sacred treasures--a mirror, sword and jewels--which were transferred from  emperor to emperor, were tax-exempt, as were 3,180 items of art owned by Hirohito that  were donated to the state.
