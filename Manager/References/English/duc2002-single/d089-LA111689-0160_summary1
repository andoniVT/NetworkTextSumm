A tornado slammed into a shopping district, residential area, and school in Huntsville,  Alabama, on Wednesday.
At least 14 were killed, nearly 300 injured, and many others  still trapped.
Alabama governor, Guy Hunt, has dispatched National Guard troops and  said rescue teams will search through the night.
Witnesses said the area was reduced to  rubble by the tornado that hit between 4 and 4:30 p.m.  Electricity and telephones are  disrupted and only one television station is still broadcasting.
Doctors are having  difficulty getting to the hospital because of blocked roads.
Most of the state had been  under a tornado watch since early afternoon.
