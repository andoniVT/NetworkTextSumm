President Corazon Aquino today reversed a long-held policy and said she was willing to  negotiate cease-fires with Communist guerrillas and former soldiers who have staged  coup attempts.
Mrs. Aquino also invited her most outspoken critic Sen. Juan Enrile to  join the talks.
Enrile said he was willing to reconcile with Mrs. Aquino, who fired him as  defense minister after he was implicated in a coup attempt in November 1986.
No one has claimed responsibility for the explosions that occur almost daily in Manila.
The Government blames them on Communist rebels who have repeatedly tried to topple  Aquino.
