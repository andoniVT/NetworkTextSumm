Patrick Edward Purdy, aka Eddie Purdy West, who killed five children at a Stockton,  California, school on Tuesday had a history of problems with the law.
Described as a  child alcoholic and loner who was mildly retarded, Purdy was a high school dropout who  held a series of jobs around the country.
Arrested numerous times since 1980, he served  at least two jail terms and twice tried to commit suicide while in custody.
In one of his  arrests, Purdy was carrying a book about the white supremacist group Aryan Nation.
At  the time, Purdy said it was his duty to help the oppressed.
