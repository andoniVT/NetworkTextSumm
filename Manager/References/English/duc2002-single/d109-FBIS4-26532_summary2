Comrade Wen Jiabao and his party left Changsha yesterday to inspect the flooded areas  of Zhuzhou and Xiangtan.
After listening to these two cities' flood fighting and relief  reports, he spoke out.
He said that by their work, the cadres and people in Zhuzhou and  Xiangtan rescued a large number of industrial and mining enterprises.
After the water  recedes we should rebuild homes and repair the damaged dikes and embankments.
Since  the peak flood season has not yet arrived we cannot slacken our efforts.
There has been  inadequate coordination between urban and rural flood control.
We should learn from  this negative experience.
