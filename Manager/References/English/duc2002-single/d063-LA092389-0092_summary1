A huge explosion yesterday in the lounge of the Royal Marines School of Music killed  ten and injured 22, eight seriously.
The School is located in Deal on the English Channel.
Eyewitness accounts of neighbors attest to the strength of the blast.
Investigators said that it was probably a bomb blast, and the IRA has claimed  responsibility.
The British think that at least two IRA "active service" units, each with  four or five members, operate in Britain and continental Europe.
Increased IRA activity  had been anticipated because last month marked the 20th anniversary of British troops   entering Northern Ireland.
