Despite the death order which stands against him, writer Salman Rushdie donated $8,600  to victims of last week's earthquake in Iran.
Rushdie to the Independent Iranian  Earthquake Appeal organized by the newspaper the Independent.
In making the  contribution Rushdie said humanitarian issues transcended all other discussion.
Rushdie  drew the wrath of the late Ayatollah Khomeini for writing "The Satanic Verses."
Khomeini sentenced Rushdie to death for writing the novel, which many muslims  consider blasphemous.
Iran announced that the donation will not change anything and  that the death sentence stands.
Rushdie has been in hiding since the death sentence was  announced in 1989.
