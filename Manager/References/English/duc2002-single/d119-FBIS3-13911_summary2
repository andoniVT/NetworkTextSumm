A column by Fahd al-Fanik in Arabic in the Amman AL-RA'Y, notes that the new US ambassador to Jordan is a heavyweight having served in Cairo, Saudi Arabia, two African countries, and a European country.
Wesley Egan, the new ambassador, is expected to pay special attention to stability in Jordan and its economic development.
However, most of al-Fanik's column is aimed at the comments of Senator Daniel Moynihan at Egan's confirmation hearing.
The writer calls the senator the "Zionist Democrat from New York".
Moynihan's saying the West Bank and Gaza are inappropriately called occupied territories, the writer says, mirrors the Zionist lobby in the US.
