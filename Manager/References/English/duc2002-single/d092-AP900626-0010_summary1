Americans who rushed to donate earthquake relief funds for the Armenian earthquake  18 months ago are responding more slowly to last week's earthquake in Iran.
Relief  agencies point out that U.S. response to events in the Middle East is not as immediate  as to those in Europe, but expect contributions to pick up when news spreads of the  effects on the lives of individuals.
At least 50,000 people were reported killed and  200,000 injured in Thursday's quake.
AmeriCares brought a shipment of supplies from  the United States into Iran on Sunday, the first of its kind to be accepted by Iran since  the hostage crisis of 1979-80.
