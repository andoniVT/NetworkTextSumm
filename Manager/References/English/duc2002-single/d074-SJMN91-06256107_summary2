Frustrated Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee say that Supreme Court  nominee Clarence Thomas is evasive, but no groundswell of opposition to his  confirmation is emerging.
Thomas, a black federal judge was picked by President Bush  to replace the retiring Thurgood Marshall, the high court's only black justice.
Thomas  said he believed the right to marital privacy was "fundamental", but he refused to give his  views on the 1973 abortion decision based on a woman's right to privacy.
On affirmative  action he said there should be no preferences, goals, timetables or quotas.
On school  prayer, he said, "Any policy of exclusion should be considered inappropriate".
