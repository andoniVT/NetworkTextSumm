Workers at KGHM in Lubin, Poland's copper producing combine went on strike yesterday as  coal-mining unions staged token stoppages in a third of the country's pits in a major challenge to  the government's economic policies.
The KGHM strike came despite a management offer to  increase wages by 20%.
Coal mining unions are also demanding wage increases as well as a  clear restructuring strategy for their industry.
The copper industry continues to show profit but coal mining is running at a loss.
This has led to  temporary lay-offs, which hit miners' incomes and led to the present bout of unrest.
