President Corazon Aquino said Friday that for security reasons she would not permit  deposed President Ferdinand Marcos to be buried in the Philippines, despite an appeal  from his wife, Imelda, that he be allowed to return.
Marcos, 71, was reported to be  hospitalized in very critical condition in Honolulu, where he has lived in exile since his  ouster in 1986.
Despite charges that Marcos stole billions of dollars from the government, the former  president still has a significant following here.
Marcos supporters said they will march  through the capital today to support his demand that he be allowed to die in the  Philippines.
