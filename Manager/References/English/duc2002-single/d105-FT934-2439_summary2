In December 1993 the Foreign Ministers of Russia and The United Kingdom spoke out  about the seriousness and the consequences of the ethnic and political conflicts in the  former Soviet Union.
They agreed that the disputes are a legitimate concern of Russians  who are concerned about clashes close to their borders, and about the welfare of ethnic  Russians living within the borders of the now independent states that had been part of the  Soviet Union.
Europe and the entire international community should share those concerns  for humanitarian reasons and because continuing conflicts risk promoting regional  instability and threats to European security.
