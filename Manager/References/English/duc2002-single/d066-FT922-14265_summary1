Sam Walton is arguably the most important retailer of his generation.
The owner of a  general store in the backwaters of Arkansas in 1950 became the world's largest retailer,  with annual sales of almost $44 billion.
Success can be attributed to Walton's personality  and his willingness to challenge retailing orthodoxy.
He was a frugal, modest, hard- working man, who made pop-in visits and delivered pep talks.
Employee satisfaction  was a vital ingredient, with bonus payments and profit-sharing plans.
Also essential is  Wal-Mart's year around high-volume, cut-price selling.
Walton proved discount stores  could be successful in rural towns and drove out hundreds of small main-street stores.
