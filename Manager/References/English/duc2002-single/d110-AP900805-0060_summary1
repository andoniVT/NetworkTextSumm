The United States urged the U.N. to impose broad economic and military sanctions on  Iraq.
The world body is expecting 14 members of the 15-member Security Council to do  so, Cuba being the holdout.
It would be the first time since 1967, when it brought  sanctions against Rhodesia, that the Security Council took such action against a member  state.
Kuwait's U.N. ambassador said that the Iraqi-installed government was employing  "pure blackmail" by saying it could not ensure the safety of foreigners if their  governments support sanctions.
The U.N. role assumes increasing significance since the  divided Arab nations have failed to act.
