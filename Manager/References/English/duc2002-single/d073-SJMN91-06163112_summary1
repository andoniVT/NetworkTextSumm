A cloud of ash-laden steam rose up to 11,500 feet above Mount Pinatubo today.
The  Philippine volcano erupted Saturday after six centuries of dormancy.
According to Peter  Lipman, a Menlo Park U.S. Geological Survey volcanologist, a major eruption could  occur causing death and destruction from hellish avalanches of hot ash.
Lipman is in  contact with five USGS scientists who remained at Clark AFB which was evacuated  along with thousands of Filipinos living near the volcano.
Thus far, ash has blown away  from the base, but the summer monsoon weather pattern will reverse the pattern.
