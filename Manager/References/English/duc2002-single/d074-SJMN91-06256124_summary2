Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas told the Senate Judiciary Committee that it is  "irrelevant"  whether he holds any personal opinion on abortion, spurring new frustration  among the committee's democrats.
Thomas' answers frustrated the committee's  Democrats who say Thomas he is evasive.
Several Senators were openly skeptical over  Thomas' insistence that he has no opinion on the 1973 Supreme Court decision legalizing  abortion.
The black federal judge also said that regarding affirmative action we should  have no preferences, goals, timetables or quotas.
He also said that natural law is nothing  more than the background to our Constitution.
