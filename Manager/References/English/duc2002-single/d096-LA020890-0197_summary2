The Los Angeles Sports Council will offer the NFL incentives to hold Super Bowl  XXVII in the Rose Bowl in 1993, including rent-free use of the stadium and all income  from concession sales.
The Rose Bowl has also proposed an $8.3-million press box  renovation.
The city would receive approximately $210,000 in taxes and parking fees.
The Council represents the Los Angeles-Orange County area in trying to attract major  sports events here.
In a report to the city Board of Directors, Pasadena's deputy city manager Ed Aghjayan  said the stadium is commonly offered rent-free in exchange for the benefits to local  economies.
