President Corazon Aquino said today she will not allow ousted leader Ferdinand Marcos  to return home to die or allow his body to be buried in the Philippines.
Marcos is in  critical condition in a Honolulu hospital suffering from renal, cardiac, and pulmonary  failure.
His wife, Imelda, and his lawyer are appealing for his return.
Imelda's  spokesman has said she is trying to reach Aquino, but this is denied by Aquino's  daughter.
Aquino's national security advisor says Marcos' return is still an option, but,  although he is no longer a threat, his followers could cause disruptions.
