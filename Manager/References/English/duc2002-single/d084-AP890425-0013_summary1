Relatives of the 47 victims killed in the No.2 gun explosion aboard the Iowa last  Wednesday were among the 6000 people who attended a memorial at Norfolk Naval Air  Station on Monday.
President Bush, a WWII Navy pilot, and the ship's commander,  Capt.
Fred P. Moosally, led the service.
Moosally praised the No.
2 gun turret crew as the best on the ship.
At the end of the  service, President and Mrs. Bush greeted and consoled the families of the lost men.
As many as 500 Iowa crewmen, delayed by traffic, were unable to attend because of  presidential security measures.
