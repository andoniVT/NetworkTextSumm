The door covering the lens of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) opened today and  Mission Control told the Discovery astronauts they are no longer needed.
When the  door was opened, however, it jarred the telescope causing two of its four gyroscopes to  stop working and the electronic system to shut down.
By early afternoon a  procedure  was started to bring the electronics back on line.
On Tuesday NASA plans to release its  first test image.
The 12-ton, 43-foot-long telescope is named for the late astronomer  Edwin P. Hubble who discovered in the 1920s that the universe is expanding.
