Moslem separatists kidnapped an Indian businessman and an educator on Friday, one day  after Indian authorities killed six separatists as they attempted to cross the Kashmir  border into Pakistan.
A caller, claiming to represent the student branch of the Jammu- Kashmir Liberation Front, told reporters that a third hostage also was held and all three  would be killed unless three jailed militants were released by Monday afternoon.
The  separatists are seeking independence for the Jammu-Kashmir state.
India claims Pakistan  is training and arming them.
The two nations have fought two wars over this area since  gaining their independence in 1947.
