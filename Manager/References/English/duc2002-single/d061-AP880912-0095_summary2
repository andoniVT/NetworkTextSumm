Hurricane Gilbert hit Jamaica today with 110 mph winds and torrential rain, causing  serious damage in Kingston overnight.
The storm center is expected to hit land at  Clarendon parish, then move lengthwise across the island.
The government is preparing  for the worst with government agencies on alert and coastal residents directed to move to  higher ground.
Communications have already been affected.
Gilbert, described as one of  the larger systems, has already caused some damage in Puerto Rico, the Dominican  Republic, Haiti, and Cuba.
Fears are high on the Cayman Islands, the next target on its  track.
