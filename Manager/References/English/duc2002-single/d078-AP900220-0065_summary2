Spike Lee's 1989 movie "Do the Right Thing" was widely hailed by critics but received  only two Academy Award nominations -- neither one Best Picture or Best Director.
32- year-old Lee blamed this on generational politics and racism, saying the academy  consisted mainly of "old people," who were more comfortable with black chauffeurs than  with the angry characters in his film.
He considered his film the best of the year.
But  students at a lecture and question-and-answer session at Syracuse University Monday  gave Lee -- one of the first African-Americans to succeed as a producer and director -- a  warm reception, saying he addressed issues affecting their community.
