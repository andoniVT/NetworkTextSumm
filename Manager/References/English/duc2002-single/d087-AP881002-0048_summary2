The 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul had no terrorist acts but was marred by drug use, most notably by Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson, and bad behavior by a few athletes.
The Soviets won the most medals, followed by the East Germans and then the US.
Because of the boycotts in 1980 and 1984, these games were the first meeting of the US and USSR since 1972.
Only Communist North Korea and sports power Cuba boycotted these games.
A estimated billion people watched the games on a worldwide TV hookup.
The Seoul games had the greatest number of athletes ever to compete in the Olympics.
