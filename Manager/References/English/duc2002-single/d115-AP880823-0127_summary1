In Nepal, police bulldozed teetering houses Tuesday to keep people from returning to  homes left unsafe by a devastating earthquake.
At least 531 people were killed in Nepal.
India's official death toll of 200 is disputed by news media and opposition politicians  who put the death count 400 and 1,500.
Most deaths occurred in victim's houses, which  were made of brick held together by mud that had been loosened by monsoon rains.
In  India, helicopters ferried medicine, rice, cooking oil, clothes and tents to police trapped in  Bihar, India's poorest state.
In Nepal, rice was being distributed to quake-affected  families.
