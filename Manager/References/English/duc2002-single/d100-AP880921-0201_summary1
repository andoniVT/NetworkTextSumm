Lennon biographer Albert Goldman has defended his controversial biography.
In it he  describes the former Beatle as a volatile, debauched recluse, who stayed in bed for days  at a time.
Family and friends of John Lennon denounced the book, charging the book  was fiction.
Goldman claims that he is being attacked because his book is bad for  business.
He says that his sensational charges of bisexuality, drug abuse and wild  drinking binges fit together with the image Lennon presented of himself.
Goldman  conducted 1200 interviews over 6 years while researching the book.
Yoko Ono,  Lennon's widow did not cooperate with the author.
