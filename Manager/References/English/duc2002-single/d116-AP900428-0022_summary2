The shuttle that put the Hubble Space Telescope into orbit carried the eyepiece from  Mount Wilson Observatory's 100-inch Hooker Telescope, constructed in 1918.
It was the  world's most powerful telescope until 1948, when the 200-inch Hale Telescope went into  operation at Mount Palomar Observatory.
Astronomer Edwin Hubble used the Hooker in  the 1920s and 1930s to take thousands of photographs of faint galaxies.
He provided the  first definite proof that other galaxies existed and observational evidence for Einstein's  theory that the universe was expanding.
He helped convince scientists the universe was  created in a giant explosion 15 billion years ago.
The Hooker Telescope was mothballed  in 1985.
