An anti-American newspaper in Iran said that the US is partly to blame for the loss of life in the recent earthquake in northern Iran.
By plundering Iran's oil and other resources, it said, the US prevented use of even a small part of national resources for development of anti-seismic construction methods.
According to the paper the Iranian people chant "Death to America".
The newspaper editorial appearing in the official Islamic Republic News Agency called upon Iranians to reject relief offers from the US and "other governments whose hands are stained with the blood of the Iranian people".
