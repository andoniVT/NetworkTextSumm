The Rev.
John D. Eales of St. Cross Episcopal Church in Hermosa Beach announced that  he would seek a disability retirement on the recommendation of his doctors because of  the severe stress.
Rev.
Eales is a victim of the McMartin trial.
Although neither the  church nor any of its officials, including Eales, were ever formally charged, the church  was subject to repeated vandalism and threats over the years because of the 1985 claim of  a former McMartin's student who claimed he had witnessed satanic rituals and animal  sacrifices at the church.
Even though the charges were never substantiated, the threats  and vandalism continued.
