John Lennon's message of peace was delivered when his song "Imagine" was played simultaneously for one billion people in 130 countries to celebrate what would have been his 50th birthday.
At a United Nations ceremony for the event, Lennon's widow, Yoko Ono said that the world is a better place because of John.
A tape that the slain former Beatle made years earlier served as an introduction.
"We all want peace, whatever sort of job we have" was Lennon's message.
Other observances were held from Liverpool to Moscow to Los Angles.
More than 1,000 radio stations from 50 countries broadcast the event.
