America has the Pulitzer Prize for fiction and the National Book Awards but in terms of  excitement, hoopla, and man-on-the-street interests, there's nothing akin to the #15,000  ($26,000) Booker Prize.
It is intended to be the equivalent of France's Prix Goncourt.
British fiction publishers each submit three new titles for a total of 93.
Literary insiders bet on  which book will win the Booker Prize.
There is a team of judges, odds are given with reviews,  the list is narrowed to the top six, and the winner announced on the last Thursday in October.
Sales figures for the winner are stunning.
