The Los Angeles Sports Council, in a bid to bring Super Bowl XXVII to the Rose Bowl in 1993,  will offer the stadium rent free to the National Football League along with all income from  concessions and sales of novelty items.
The Council selected the Rose Bowl because it has  103,083 seats.
Under a joint agreement, Anaheim Stadium and the Coliseum did not submit bids  but they would share in the revenues if Pasadena gets the game.
The share is still being  negotiated.
One plan calls for the Rose Bowl to receive 75% of the proceeds; the other two  sharing 25%.
