Saturday Manila newspapers quoted Teodoro Benigno, President Corazon Aquinoi's press  secretary, saying Mrs. Aquino told Swiss lawyers that Ferdinand Marcos will be allowed  to return to the Philippines so that he can be tried for stealing billions of dollars.
The Philippine government said it will file criminal charges against former President  Marcos, claiming he stole up to $10 billion of government funds.
Mrs. Aquino, however,  has previously refused to let Marcos return from exile in Hawaii, citing security concerns.
Philippine law prohibits trial in absentia.
Swiss lawyers are helping the Philippine government trace money that Marcos allegedly  placed in Swiss banks.
