Iraq ended its eight-year war with Iran with an estimated $70 billion debt.
These war  bills keep the government from delivering promised benefits to the Iraqi people.
Iraq  also wishes for a longer gulf coastline.
Recently Saddam Hussein accused Kuwait of  costing Iraq billions by overproducing oil, thus driving down its price, by stealing oil  from a contested border field and by demanding repayment of war debts.
He seemed  determined to solve his financial and territorial ambitions by conquering his neighbor.
Iraq has always refused to recognize Kuwait's independence.
He could also use this  invasion to browbeat other neighbors on local policy issues.
