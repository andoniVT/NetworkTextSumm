Boris Yeltsin, the leader of the resistance to the coup is now at least the equal, if not the master of Gorbachev.
In a symbol of the new order, the Russian tricolor now flies beside the Soviet red flag at the Kremlin gate.
At a joint appearance before the Russian parliament, Yeltsin signed a decree suspending the activities of the Russian Communist Party as Gorbachev stammered.
Yeltsin was the first to announce appointments to three key positions.
All three appointees had taken a clear stand against the coup.
Yeltsin was clearly in control of the situation and Gorbachev's position was weakening drastically.
