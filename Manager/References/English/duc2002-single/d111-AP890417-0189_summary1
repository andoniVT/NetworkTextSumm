The merchant ship Ravenscraig rescued 23 crewmembers of the Star of Alexandria, which sank in rough seas 400 miles southeast of Cape Cod.
Two sailors are still missing.
The British-registered ship was en route from Athens to New York with a load of cement when it began taking on water in the rough seas.
The US Coast Guard responded to the mayday call and sent a jet and a C-130 to the scene.
The C-130 was dropped a radio to the crew and they were able to establish communications.
Four hours later, the Ravenscraig, en route to England, rescued them.
