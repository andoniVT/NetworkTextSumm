An opinion piece in the Los Angeles Times, referred to the death of Emperor Hirohito as  finishing the list of political and military leaders of the World War II leaders, one of the  darkest and bloodiest eras for both Asia and Europe.
Hirohito's role during the war was  never clear but he was worshiped in Japan as a god.
The author finds it hard to believe  that a man in Hirohito's position and with his influence, had nothing to do with Japanese  aggression.
The author hopes that Hirohito's soul is ready to face justice when he meets  the millions murdered in his name.
