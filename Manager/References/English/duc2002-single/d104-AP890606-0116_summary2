As armies loyal to rival factions exchanged fire and soldiers continued to fire into  crowds around Beijing today, anti-government demonstrations spread to Shanghai,  Nanjing, Chengdu and other cities.

It is now apparent that the assault on Tiananmen Square last Sunday neither  ended the movement nor ended the government's forceful answer to demands for  reform.
