Ousted East German leader Erich Honecker was arrested and taken to prison after his release  from a hospital where he underwent surgery for a kidney tumor.
He is to be tried for high treason  in March, along with former Politburo members Erich Mielke, Guenter Mittag, and Joachim  Hermann.
Eleven other ousted members are in prison awaiting trial.
East Germany has been in a  frenzy to root out corruption.
Honecker could be sentenced to a maximum of life imprisonment.
His doctors say that he is too  ill to stay in jail.
East Germany's Lutheran Church has offered to place him in a home for the  aged.
