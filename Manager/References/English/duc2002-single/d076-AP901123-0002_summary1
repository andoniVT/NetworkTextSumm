Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, considered America's best friend for almost a decade,  has decided to retire.
President Bush called her an outstanding ally of the United States.
Her closest ties, however, were with former President Reagan..
They were ideological  soul mates who were usually side by side at international gatherings.
Calling each other  Ronnie and Margaret, they shared similar political and economic views.
During the  British clash with Argentina, the United States was forced to choose between two allies.
President Bush was more experienced in world politics and knew many world leaders and  Mrs. Thatcher became just one of the gang.
