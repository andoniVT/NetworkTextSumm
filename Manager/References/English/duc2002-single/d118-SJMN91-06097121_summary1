Former Senator John Tower of Texas and his daughter were among 23 people killed in a commuter plane crash.
Tower was en route from Atlanta to Sea Island, off the Georgia coast to attend a party in his honor.
Just the day before, Senator John Heinz of Pennsylvania and his daughter were killed in a plane-helicopter collision that involved the same type aircraft that Tower was in.
Officials did not know the cause of the crash of Tower's plane.
Statements of loss came from Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas and Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia.
Both used the word patriot.
