John Lennon, My Brother was the collaboration of Beatles aficionado, Geoffrey Giuliano, and Julia Baird, half-sister of the late John Lennon.
Giuliano had wanted to do a book on Lennon while Baird wanted to concentrate on her and John's often maligned mother, also named Julia.
The book, which contains many photos, is more of a family album than biography and is a narrow view of Lennon.
It is a mishmash of anecdotes but mostly tells of a mother and son who, though living apart had a loving relationship.
Former Beatle Paul McCartney blessed the book and wrote a forward for it.
