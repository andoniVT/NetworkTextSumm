More than a dozen bombs exploded yesterday afternoon in Bombay, killing about 200  and injuring more than a 1,000.
The devices, mostly car bombs, appeared to be a  systematic attack on India's commercial heart.
Targets included the Bombay Stock  Exchange, Air India building, a shopping complex, and two hotels near the airport.
The  identity of the bombers is unknown, but the goal appears to be renewing communal strife  and undermining government efforts to attract foreign investment and tourism.
Leaders  have called for calm.
All roads into Bombay are blocked and the army is on alert.
