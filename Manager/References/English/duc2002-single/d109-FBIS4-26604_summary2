The highest flood peaks on the Xijiang and Beijiang Rivers have passed, said Zhu Senlin,  governor of south China's Guangdong Province.
No breaches of major embankments or  reservoirs were reported despite the most serious flood in a hundred years.
Eleven  million people in the province's nine cities and 55 counties were affected, more than 200  people died, 189,000 rooms were destroyed and 1.2 million hectares of crops were ruined  in this natural disaster.
Economic losses were set at 10.2 billion yuan.
The really bad  news is that this is just the beginning.
The main flood season has not yet started.
