Thursday Secretary-designate Florencio Abad, whose nomination was opposed by the  pro-Aquino Struggle of the Democratic Filipino Party, resigned.
His resignation  reinforces suspicion among liberals that Mrs. Aquino is not as committed to social  change as they expected when she took power in 1986.
Abad's difficulties began in February when he tried unsuccessfully to block the lease of  government land to Japan's Marubeni Corp., for an industrial park, believing the land  should be distributed instead to peasants.
Abad's stand, alarmed landowners in Congress,  and lawmakers on the Commission on Appointments who belong to the pro-Aquino party  blocked his appointment through eight hearings.
