British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev  emerged from a meeting in which they were said to have argued passionately.
A Thatcher  spokesman said the Soviet President and the Prime Minister loved arguing.
Subjects  covered in the meeting ranged from nuclear disarmament to the sale of Soviet bombers to  Libya.
When Thatcher asked Gorbachev about the sale, the Soviet President did not  respond.
Thatcher expressed doubts on the Soviet statement about the Soviet's chemical  arsenal and disagreed with Gorbachev's position that nuclear weapons should be  eliminated from Europe.
Mrs. Thatcher believes that the presence of nuclear weapons  deters war.
