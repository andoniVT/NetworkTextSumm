After devastating Guadeloupe, Montserrat, Antigua, the Virgin Islands and Puerto  Rico on Sunday and Monday with winds up to 150 mph, killing at least 20 people  and leaving perhaps 100,000 homeless, Hurricane Hugo slowed down yesterday to  winds of 105-125 mph, only to pick up speed again and crash into Charleston,  S.C. at midnight with winds of 135 mph.
In addition to flooding, fires erupted  from natural gas leaks in Charleston and ten people were killed in the  Carolinas.
Today the hurricane moved inland with steadily diminishing winds and  was downgraded to a tropical storm at 6 A.M.
