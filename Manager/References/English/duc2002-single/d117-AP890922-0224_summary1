The winner of the 1989 Booker Prize, Britain's top literary award, will be announced on  26 October.
The six novels on the short-list have been named and British bookmakers  have established Kazuo Ishiguro's "The Remains of the Day" as a seven-to-four favorite  to win the 31,600-dollar prize.
Interest in the Booker this year is expected to be even higher than usual this year because  of last year's controversy.
Salman Rushdie, a British citizen, was an unsuccessful  contender last year for his "Satanic Verses".
Ayatollah Khomeni alleged that the book  blasphemed Islam, and he threatened Rushdie's life.
