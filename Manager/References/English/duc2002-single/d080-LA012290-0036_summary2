A Hermosa Beach minister, originally implicated in the McMartin Pre-School  molestation scandal, is seeking disability retirement.
Rev.
John D. Eales heads St. Cross  Episcopal Church where children allegedly were forced to watch animal sacrifices and  Satanic rituals in 1985.
These allegations were never confirmed, but membership fell and  the minister and church continued to face threatening phone calls and vandal attacks.
More recently, a youth counselor at the church was charged with molesting two teenaged  boys.
The stress has become too great for Eales, 61.
The McMartin trial, the longest  criminal case in history, ended Thursday with no convictions.
