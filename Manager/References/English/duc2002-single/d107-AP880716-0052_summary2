Drought conditions continue to affect the nation as state officials seek to deal with the  water shortage.
In Alabama, recent rains have done little to help urban areas and the  state's cotton supply is in critical condition while officials of Elk Horn, Iowa look for  drinking water for their town.
High temperatures in other areas, combined with the  drought have raised the danger of forest fires and have threatened logging interests in  Michigan.
Elsewhere, severe summer storms which have spawned tornados in Kansas  and caused high winds in Indiana and Michigan, causing widespread damage did little to  alleviate drought conditions in those states.
