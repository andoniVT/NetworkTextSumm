Indiana Republican Senator Dan Quayle, 41, was chosen by George Bush to be his   presidential running mate.
Quayle, from Huntington, Indiana, graduated from a small  liberal arts college, DePauw University, in 1970 and went to work in the Indiana  Attorney General's office.
He met his wife Marilyn, 39, when they were law students at  Indiana University in Indianapolis.
They married in 1972 while still in school.
They have  three children, 14-year-old son Tucker, 12-year-old son Benjamin, and 9-year-old  daughter Corinne.
Quayle is said to be the same nice guy he was in law school.
His sister  Martha Saddler lives in Huntington.
