Moslem militants kidnapped two prominent Kashmir residents and threatened to kill them in retaliation for the killing of six militants crossing into Pakistan for arms and training.
The kidnap victims were the Vice Chancellor of Kashmir University and the general manager of Hindustan Machine Tools Co. A spokesman for the Students Liberation Front, a branch of the Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front said those two and another hostage would be killed within 24 hours unless three jailed militants were released.
India claims that Pakistan trains and arms militants in the far northern tip of India.
Pakistan denies this claim.
