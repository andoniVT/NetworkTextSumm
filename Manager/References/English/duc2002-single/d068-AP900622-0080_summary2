Today at an elaborate ceremony that brought together top diplomats of the two  Germanys and the four World War II allies, a crane removed Checkpoint Charlie,  symbol of a divided world.
The German and allied foreign ministers are meeting in East  Berlin to discuss the status of the city and U.S. officials decided this was a good time to  remove Checkpoint Charlie.
All borders are to be opened between the Berlins and  Germanys by July 2.
Large sections of the Berlin Wall are being dismantled daily.
Berliners witnessed the ceremony from nearby buildings recounting memories of   attempts to escape from East Berlin through the checkpoint.
