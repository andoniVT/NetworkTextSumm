Hugo, a category 4 hurricane, struck South Carolina Thursday and officials hoped  precautions were sufficient.
As Hugo approached, roads and resort towns from Hilton  Head to Myrtle Beach were nearly empty as coastal residents fled inland and crowded  into shelters.
Hurricane-force winds first hit land at 9:15pm.
Three hours later the 10-mile  eye of the storm passed just east of Charleston, with top winds of 135 mph.
119-mph  winds in Charleston brought down power lines, snapped trees, exploded utility  transformers, and littered the street with tin roofs.
Schools and businesses were closed.
Hugo was expected to turn north, cause severe flooding, and bring tornadoes.
