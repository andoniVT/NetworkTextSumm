West German Chancellor Kohl said in Moscow that Soviet President Gorbachev had  given him an unequivocal promise to respect German reunification.
He said that a  reunification plan with the agreement of the World War II Allies should be ready before  the year's end for presentation to pan-European summit meeting.
Pressure for German reunification has increased since the ouster of the hard-line  Communist leadership.
Despite East German reforms, nearly 2,000 leave the country  daily, further crippling an already troubled economy.
The West German Finance Minister  said the East German economy is in sorrowful state.
