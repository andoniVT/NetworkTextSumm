Representative Larry Combest supports his former boss, John Tower, for Defense Secretary but declined to comment on a published report that Tower would drink a bottle of scotch at a sitting.
An unnamed source stated that Combest once said Tower would drink as much as a full bottle of scotch two or three times a week.
Tower has acknowledged that he drank excessively during the 1970s but now drinks only wine with dinner and if confirmed as defense secretary would not drink a drop of alcohol.
The Senate Armed Services Committee, controlled by Democrats, voted 11-9 recommending that the full Senate reject Tower=B9s nomination.
