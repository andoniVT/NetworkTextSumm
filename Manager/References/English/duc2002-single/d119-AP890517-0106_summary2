The Senate Foreign Relations Committee endorsed the nomination of Republican activist Peter Secchia to be ambassador to Italy.
The chairman, Senator Pell, had many misgivings about the nomination but did not vote against Secchia.
Secchia pledged to be more careful in his use of language as a diplomat that he had used as an activist.
Pell was not convinced.
He said that the nomination was a mistake and that "in all likelihood Mr. Secchia will be an embarrassment to the administration and the United States".
However, since Secchia is the president's choice he would not try to block it.
