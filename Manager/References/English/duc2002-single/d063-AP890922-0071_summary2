An explosion at the Royal Marines School of Music in the southeastern coastal town of  Deal killed eight people and injured 30.
Up to 18 people were feared trapped in the  rubble.
The reason for the blast, which occurred at 8:26 a.m. in a lounge in the barracks is  not known but a forensic team from Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist squad had been called  in to help investigate.
The injured are suffering from injuries typical of an explosion.
In  recent years, military targets on the British mainland have been attacked by the Irish  Republican Army as it seeks to rid Northern Ireland of British rule.
