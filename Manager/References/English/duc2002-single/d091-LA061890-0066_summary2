On Sunday searchers in the rural area of eastern Ohio found a body in debris along  Wegee Creek and extracted two from the Ohio River, bringing the death toll from flash  floods that swept through the area last Thursday to19.
Eighteen people are still missing.
As many as 70 houses were destroyed.
Investigators Sunday blamed the flash floods on an unusually heavy rainstorm that  overwhelmed the designed flow capacities of three bridges over the Wegee and Pipe  creeks.
Rainwater running down hillsides forced debris into the creeks, forming dams at  each bridge.
The "dams" broke under the water pressure.
