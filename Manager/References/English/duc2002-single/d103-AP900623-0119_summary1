Supplies, medical personnel, and condolences have begun to arrive in Iran where about  40,000 died in an earthquake.
Responding to the humanitarian need, countries both  friendly and hostile to Tehran's Islamic government have contributed to the relief effort.
The United States, which broke diplomatic relations with Iran, will provide aid through  the American Red Cross.
In addition to supplies, the Soviet Union sent a professional life  saving team from the Armenian capital of Yerevan.
The French have said they will send a  mobile hospital unit if Iran wants it.
Pope John Paul II also donated to the effort.
