Critic and novelist Antonia Byatt won the Booker Prize, Britain's most prestigious literary award  for "Possession", one of the year's six finalists in the 21-year old competition.
She received  $39,000 and earlier this month received the $43,000 Times-Aer Lingus prize for international  faction for the same work.
The Booker Prize was announced at a banquet in London's  Elizabethan Guildhall, seat of the city's Lord Mayor.
Her book is a tale of two young scholars  investigating the lives of a pair of imaginary Victorian poets by retracing the poets' journeys  across England and to France.
She has published five novels since 1964.
