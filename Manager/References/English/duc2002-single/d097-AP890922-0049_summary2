Hurricane Hugo has put to test the city of Charleston, S.C. which has survived  earthquake, battle and storm in its 300-year history.
The storm with winds reaching 135  mph hit Charleston head-on Thursday night, the first major hurricane to strike  Charleston since Hurricane Gracie made landfall 70 miles to the south in 1959.
Charleston has survived a tornado that killed 32 people, injured hundreds and caused  $2 million in property damage in 1938, shot and shell of two wars, any number of  smaller hurricanes, and the earthquake of Aug. 31, 1886 that measured 7.7 on the  Richter scale, killed 110, and destroyed 102 buildings.
