East Germany's ousted secret police chief, Erich Mielke, threatened to break former  Communist leader Erich Honecker's neck when the two faced each other in jail.
After  the popular revolt last fall that ousted the Communist regime and opened the way for  German unification, Mielke and other former Communist leaders were jailed.
Mielke  remains in custody, Honecker was released for health reasons.
Many of the prison  guards had worked for Mielke's secret police and might interpret his threat against  Honecker as an order to kill him.
Honecker will be moved to a West Berlin prison after  unification if his health improves.
