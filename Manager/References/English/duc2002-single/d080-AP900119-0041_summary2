Who is to blame for the nation's longest and costliest trial, the McMartin Pre-School  molestation case, which ended Thursday?
Raymond Buckey and his mother were  acquitted on 52 counts and the jury deadlocked on the remaining 13.
Parents are blaming  the system.
The original prosecutor, Robert Philibosian, denies he began the case to  boost his run for district attorney and blames Ira Reiner, the current district attorney.
Philibosian said Reiner hurt the case by dismissing charges against five defendants.
Reiner claims he inherited a mess.
Many jurors believe some of the children were  molested, but the state did not prove the defendants responsible.
