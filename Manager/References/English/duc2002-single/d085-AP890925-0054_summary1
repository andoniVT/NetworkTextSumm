The low number of deaths from powerful Hurricane Hugo can be credited to residents'  healthy respect for forecasters' warnings.
The storm caused billions in damage and  claimed 17 lives in South Carolina.
Only two died in the Charleston area, which bore the  brunt of Hugo's 135mph winds.
18,000 thousand endangered residents went into shelters  and tens of thousands evacuated inland, heading up I26 toward Columbia.
The last big  storm to hit South Carolina was Hurricane David in 1979.
Several big storms have  threatened since then but veered away.
Officials worried that Charlestonians wouldn't  heed warnings about Hugo since there had been so many false alarms.
