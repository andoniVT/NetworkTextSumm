Saudi Arabia offered shelter to the Kuwaiti ruling family after they fled their homeland  Thursday.
For a brief period the Kuwaitis in Saudi Arabia were allowed to air radio  broadcasts.
Other than that the Saudis have offered no tangible help to Kuwait.
Oil executives said that Saudi Arabia has not and will not close the pipeline that carries  Iraqi oil across Saudi Arabia to the Red Sea because they do not want to provoke an Iraqi  attack.
Turkey has not commented on President Bush's suggestion that Turkey close the  parallel pipelines that pump Iraqi oil across Turkey to a Mediterranean Sea port.
