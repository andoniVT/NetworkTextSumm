An explosion at 8:28 A.M. today destroyed a military barracks near Deal.
Police said that  11 were killed and 22 injured.
The British Defense Ministry would not confirm the  casualty figures.
The barracks housed the Royal Marines School of Music.
Dozens of   home were damaged, some severely.
The IRA issued a statement saying what happened to the Royal Marines was an answer  to Margaret Thatcher's "message of war".
The British Defense Secretary said that all  evidence points to the explosion being an Irish atrocity.
If so, it would be the worst attack  on the British mainland in over seven years.
