John Lennon decided that it was time to make music again after devoting several years to his son while Yoko Ono ran the family business.
Lennon cut two more albums before his death in December, 1980.
Since then, Ono has overseen the release of several albums of John's music and the syndication of a radio program featuring previously unpublished  songs.
Many believe that Ono has made millions promoting these ventures and she has been called "The Merry Widow".
Ono is circumspect about where the money goes except to say that some goes to the Spirit Foundation, the charitable foundation that she and John founded.
