Analysts and industry spokesmen say most San Francisco-area homeowners may have to pay out  of their own pockets for Tuesday's earthquake.
About two-thirds of earthquake insurance  policies in the US are sold in California.
However, only about 25 to 30% of the homes in the  earthquake-prone San Francisco area have earthquake insurance.
Insurers might face bills totaling $1 billion or more but no company is expected to suffer serious  financial damage.
It is predicted that the quake damages may in fact lead to rate hikes, although  insurers and state legislators are battling over the rates and how they are set.
