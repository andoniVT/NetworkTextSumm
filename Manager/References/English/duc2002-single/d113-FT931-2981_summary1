India suffered a fresh wave of terror last night when an explosion in the crowded trade  and residential district of Bowbazaar in Calcutta destroyed two blocks of flats killing at  least 45 people and injuring scores more.
A militant Sikh group fighting for the  independence of Punjab claims responsibility for the blast, but police and the interior  minister suspect a foreign group or "an international conspiracy."
The attack came just  four days after a systematic bomb attack on India's commercial heart in Bombay,  raising fears of a resumption of last December's intercommunal violence.
Last night  national and local leaders appealed for calm.
