President Corazon Aquino said Friday that she would not permit ousted leader Ferdinand  Marcos to be buried in the Philippines.
He is near death in Hawaii, where he has been in  exile.
His wife, Imelda, is maintaining a vigil and appealing for his return.
Aquino said  she is praying for his recovery, but will not allow his remains to be returned.
Although  Marco is accused of looting the nation's treasury and is under U.S. indictment, he still has  supporters in the Philippines.
They are accused of at least three coup attempts and now  are planning a demonstration for Sunday.
