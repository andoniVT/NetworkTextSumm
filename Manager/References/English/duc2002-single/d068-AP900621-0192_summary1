A ceremony held on Friday and attended by Secretary of State James Baker and Soviet  Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze as well as their colleagues from France, Britain,  and the two Germanys marked the removal of Checkpoint Charlie, the allied checkpoint  20 yards from the crossing into East Berlin.
The envoys from the two German states and  the four World War II allies were in Berlin to discuss German reunification.
Checkpoint  Charlie became superfluous last Fall when East Germany overthrew its communist  government and the German borders were opened.
As sections of the wall continue to be  torn down the U.S. decided two weeks ago to remove Checkpoint Charlie.
