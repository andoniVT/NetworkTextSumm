The "coup people" thought they could take over by neutralizing Gorbachev and threatening  everyone.
However, to the people the real issue was not Gorbachev but the new political culture  of freedom and democracy that his reforms had created.
The Soviets resisted the putsch and  created a new, decentralized and smaller Soviet Union quicker than anticipated.
Gorbachev  initiated the changes and history will credit him for that.
His standing, however, was transformed  when he was trumped by Boris Yeltsin who, unlike Gorbachev, challenged the Communist Party  with eagerness and stayed close to the Russian people, who made him a formidable political  force.
