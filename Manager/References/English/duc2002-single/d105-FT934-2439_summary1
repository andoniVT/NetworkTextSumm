The international community is becoming increasingly aware of the true magnitude of ethnic and political conflicts in the former Soviet Union.
Russia is concerned about conflicts close to its borders, about the safety of ethnic Russians living in those areas and about refugees fleeing to Russia.
They argue that the international community should undertake peacekeeping missions in these areas as they have in other hotspots.
These areas should be of concern to the international community both for humanitarian reasons and because they risk provoking regional instability.
If such peacekeeping missions are undertaken, respect for the sovereignty of the newly independent countries must remain paramount.
