Some believe that the recording of John Major's conversation with Michael Brunson,  ITN's political editor, in which Major used salty language will improve Major's image as  a wimp.
Not so.
Major is gone, especially after the Christchurch by-election where a  Conservative majority in last year's general election was transformed to a liberal  Democrats majority of 16,427.
Actually, all politicians are far more candid when speaking privately.
To demonstrate, I  spoke yesterday with both Major and John Smith, Labor Party leader.
Using a scrambler,  to guarantee privacy, I provoked some frank discussion.
The rambling responses of both  were liberally sprinkled with expletives.
