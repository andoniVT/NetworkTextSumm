Thursday night about 30 members of the Filipino-American Movement for a Better  Philippines held a candlelight vigil outside the Philippine Consulate in Los Angeles in  support of the military coup attempt unfolding in their homeland.
Some of the protesters  entered the consulate offices and confronted a coalition of four Los Angeles, pro-Aquino  Filipino groups holding a press conference.
After some minutes of shouting between the  Aquino supporters and the anti-government protesters, the protesters departed and order  was restored.
The coup attempt is being led by officers linked to renegade Lt. Col. Gregorio Honasan.
Present at the LA press conference was Andrea Aquino, niece of assassinated Marcos  opponent Benigno Aquino, Cory Aquino's husband.
