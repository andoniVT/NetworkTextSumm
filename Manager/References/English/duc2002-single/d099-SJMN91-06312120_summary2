Tour companies are organizing international trips for individuals and families who want  to incorporate running into their vacations.
The tours are geared to those who want to run  in a marathon and last year one tour operator took 5,500 people to tours to 20 countries  from Bermuda to Moscow.
Runners are guaranteed spots in restricted entry races, such  as the London Marathon, which is the world's largest.
But many marathons also offer  shorter races ranging from 5 miles to a half-marathon.
Some of the tours also include  sightseeing, guided runs and fun runs into the trip.
