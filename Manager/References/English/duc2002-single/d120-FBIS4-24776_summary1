In local elections across Britain yesterday, the Conservatives suffered their worst defeat  ever, losing 444 seats.
They are now the third party nationally.
Some anti-John Major Conservatives are happy about the defeat.
Propelled to power by  Margaret Thatcher who expected to continue her program discretely, Major is a weak  leader.
Though some pushed him to pursue new "leftist" policies, Major vacillates to the  left and to the right, producing a "crisis of honor."
He lacks vision, is incompetent on domestic and international issues, and is a political  blunderer.
The Tories will make him a scapegoat for their defeat at the polls.
