Gorbachev chose to ignore warnings of the hard-liners impending coup.
Some warnings came from his advisors, but the clearest signals came from the hard-liners themselves.
Defense Council Deputy Oleg Baklanov had called for a military takeover as an appropriate step to avert reforms, but Gorbachev ignored the warnings.
Conspiracy theorists find fuel from Gorbachev's actions before and during the coup.
Some say that he was a member of the conspiracy in order to thwart the signing of the new Union Treaty or to ferret out disloyal elements.
But it is clear that Gorbachev put the hard-liners in power despite their mutterings about him.
