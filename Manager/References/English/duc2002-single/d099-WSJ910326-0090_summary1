John Kelley is training for the 1992 Boston Marathon next April.
At 83 years of age he  will be the oldest competitor, as he has been for 15 years.
Kelley won the marathon in  1935 and again in 1945, and expects to finish ahead of many of the 13,000 who will  compete in April.
Each year Kelley visits the Cooper Clinic in Dallas where he undergoes a battery of tests.
The clinic gives a stress test and Kelley holds the endurance record for his age group.
Doctor Cooper says Kelley is a medical marvel.
