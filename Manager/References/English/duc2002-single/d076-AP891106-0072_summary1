Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was criticized or speculating on her political future.
In  an interview with the Sunday Correspondent, Mrs. Thatcher said she hoped to lead her  Conservative Party to a fourth successive election but that she doubted that she would try  for a fifth.
The admission has weakened her position according to her political opponents.
The Sunday Times of London called the admission a colossal blunder.
Mrs. Thatcher has  served longer than any other prime minister of the 20th Century.
If the Conservatives win  the next election, Mrs. Thatcher is expected to step down before the end of her term,  paving the ay for her successor.
