The earthquake that struck Iran reminded a US geophysicist of the 1988 quake in Armenia.
The Iran quake was of magnitude 7.7 while the Armenian was 6.9 but both killed about 25,000 persons and for essentially the same reasons: most victims were in houses that were shoddily built or otherwise fragile and could collapse easily.
The death toll in Iran was high because it happened at night when most people were asleep.
This quake was the strongest ever recorded in Iran, which is in a very active seismic region and has recorded 12 quakes of magnitude 7 in the past 30 years.
