The Senate voted 53 to 47 to reject the nomination of former Texas Senator John tower as  Secretary of Defense.
The vote came after a bitter and divisive debate which centered on Tower's  drinking habits, his inappropriate behavior toward women and business dealings with defense  contractors.
This is only the ninth time that a president's cabinet choice has been rejected and the  first time it has occurred so early in a new administration.
The defeat was credited to the decision  by Senator Sam Nun, Chairman of the Armed Services Committee, to oppose him.
Nunn's  decision caused the other Democrats on the committee to fall in line behind him.
