In four television interviews that began airing today, British Prime Minister John Major,  said all Iraqi troops must withdraw from Kuwait or they will be "forcibly removed."
Major arrived in Washington Thursday night for on a three-day visit to the U.S.
He and  President Bush will hold discussions this evening at Camp David in Maryland where they  will spend the night.
Major's stance on Iraq was as unyielding as that of his predecessor, Margaret Thatcher,  but unlike Mrs. Thatcher, he was polite to reporters questioning him.
Comparing Major  and Thatcher, one U.S. official said, "The biggest change is personal style."
