A ranking member of Chairman's Helmut Kohl's party demanded that the Soviet Union  turn over Erich Honecker, who is wanted by German authorities on manslaughter  charges.
A Berlin court has issued an arrest warrant for Honecker, 78, for issuing shoot- to-kill orders to East German guards at the now-fallen Berlin Wall.
Honecker has denied  all charges against him, including that he was responsible for the estimated 200 people  who died trying to escape East Germany.
Honecker's fate is one of the first issues  facing Bonn and Moscow since they signed several treaties designed to draw the two  nations closer.
