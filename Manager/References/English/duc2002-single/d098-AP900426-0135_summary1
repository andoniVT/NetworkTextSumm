NASA ground controllers finally made contact today with the two main antennas on the  Hubble Space Telescope (HST) after trying for more than six hours to lock on.
The HST  will be tested today for its ability to maneuver before the aperture door is opened Friday  exposing the finely polished 94.5-inch mirror to starlight.
Then on Tuesday NASA  expects to release the first image from the telescope.
Astronomers hope to use the  HST to determine how and when the universe was formed.
The telescope was originally  scheduled for launch in 1983 but was delayed by technical problems and the  Challenger accident.
