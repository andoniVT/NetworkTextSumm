Soviet human rights activist Andrei D. Sakharov was elected in April to the new Soviet  Congress of People's Deputies, two years after being released from seven years of  internal exile.
On Sunday, he praised the Soviet's new course in world affairs,  demonstrated by withdrawal from Afghanistan, but criticized internal measures  restricting freedom of speech.
He likened them to measures against dissidents like  himself in the 1970s and 1980s and called use of toxic gas against demonstrators in  Soviet Georgia anti-democratic.
He said reforms of the old centralized system were too  slow.
People were losing interest because they couldn't buy anything.
The country was  on the brink of economic catastrophe.
