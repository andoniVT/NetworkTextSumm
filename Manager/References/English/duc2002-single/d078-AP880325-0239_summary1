In the 60-year history of the Academy Awards, there are numerous examples of  Hollywood's highest achievers being overlooked.
The latest casualties are directors  James L. Brooks, whose movie "Broadcast News" won seven major nominations,  including best picture, and Steven Spielberg whose movie "Empire of the Sun" received  six nominations.
Though Brooks has a Best Director trophy ("Terms of Endearment" (1984)), Spielberg  has never been recognized with the coveted award.
Last year the Academy appeared to  make amends by presenting him with the Irving Thalberg award, an honorary award that  was also given to other overlooked giants such as Hitchcock and DeMille.
