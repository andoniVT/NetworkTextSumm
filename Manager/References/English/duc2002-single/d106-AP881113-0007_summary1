The African National Congress representative in Canada said that the South African government may release 70-year old Nelson Mandela from prison on November 15th.
Mandela was sentenced to life in prison 27 years ago for conspiring to overthrow the South African apartheid government.
Mandela was transferred from prison to a hospital three months for treatment of tuberculosis.
Release of Mandela would be viewed as a move by the South African government to win international support.
A government source said that the anti-apartheid movement had orchestrated the rumors of Mandela's pending release to pressure the government to take action.
