Tuesday's 6.9 earthquake was probably a strike-slip quake with one fault side grinding  horizontally past another.
The fracture was 10 miles deep and stretched 30 miles south  from the epicenter, which was the southernmost point of maximum ground slippage in  1906 and earlier identified as 30% likely for a major jolt in the next 30 years.
Scientists  are concerned at the increase of recent 5-magnitude quakes, similar to those preceding the  1906 quake.
Some of nearby San Jose's recent Calaveras fault quakes may have added  pressure on the San Andreas fault, California's longest and most deadly.
Damages  include building and highway collapses, Marina district fires, and deaths.
