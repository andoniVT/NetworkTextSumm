The shortlist of six for the #20,000 Booker Prize for fiction prompted the publishing industry to  comment that some on the list "are B-team writers at best" and that others "don't make the  grade".
This is surprising commentary given it is a bumper year for new fiction fulfilling the  criteria--English language and non-American.
There was some traditional controversy when it was revealed that an author whose novel had  made the longlist was actually the wife of a Booker judge.
But critics say it's the final list, not  the controversy, which must have a final death blow to the Booker.
