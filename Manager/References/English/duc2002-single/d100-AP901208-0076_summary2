Liverpool's mayor, Dorothy Gavin, and John Lennon devotees, laid wreaths at a bronze statue of the Beatles in the city's Cavern Walks shopping center on the tenth anniversary of his death.
The center was built at the original site of the Cavern Club made famous when the Beatles played there in the 1960s.
Father Tom MacKenzie, who was immortalized in the Beatles' 1966 hit song, "Eleanor Rigby" was present at the ceremony.
Lennon was shot when he and his wife, Yoko Ono, were returning to their apartment in New York.
Ono and son Sean would spend the anniversary privately.
