As punishment for not withdrawing its forces from Kuwait, the U.N. Security Council  voted to impose trade and military sanctions against Iraq, including a ban on oil  purchases.
It was only the third time in the U.N.'s 45-year existence that it voted  sanctions against a member state.
The sanctions are legally binding for all member  nations, although past resolutions have often been ignored or flouted.
Earlier, the Iraqi- installed military government of Kuwait warned other nations to not take punishing  measures against it or Iraq, ominously saying that such countries "have to remember they  have interests and citizens in Kuwait."
