Seismologists had targeted the area struck by Tuesday's earthquake as the most likely  spot in Northern California for a strong quake, with 30% probability of a 6.5 quake by the  year 2018.
The central California town of Parkfield has a 90% probability, the state's  highest.
Probability calculation includes length of time since the last major quake.
Tuesday's 6.9 quake was centered in the Santa Cruz area, 75 miles south of San  Francisco.
The widespread damage especially affected highways and old masonry  buildings that have the same type of structure as those heavily damaged in the 1987  Whittier quake in the Los Angeles area, which measured 5.9.
