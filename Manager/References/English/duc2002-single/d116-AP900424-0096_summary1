Shortly after launch aboard the shuttle Discovery on Tuesday, the Hubble Space  Telescope sent its first test radio signal.
Cheers erupted in Huston's Mission Control.
Some scientists have hailed the Hubble as the greatest advance in astronomy since  Galileo first raised a small telescope to his eye nearly 400 years ago.
The Hubble is  expected to help answer two major questions: How old is the universe?
How big is the  Universe?
The telescope is comprised of two mirrors, two cameras, two spectrometers  and a photometer.
Now running on batteries, astronauts are standing by to act should its  solar power panels fail to unfurl.
