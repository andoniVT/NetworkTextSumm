British media entrepreneur Robert Maxwell, who publishes Britain's Daily Mirror, said Monday  he is involved in negotiations to buy a U.S. newspaper worth "hundreds of millions of dollars."
The newspaper was not identified but there is speculation that it might be The New York Daily  News, which is struggling to restore profitability; USA Today, which would mesh with  Maxwell's efforts for the new paper The European; or the Chicago Sun-Times that has been  sliding in circulation since 1985.
Officials of each of these newspapers denied they were negotiating with Maxwell, who recently  bought three US tabloids: the Globe, National Examiner, and the Sun.
