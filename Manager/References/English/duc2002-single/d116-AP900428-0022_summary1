The eyepiece used by astronomer Edwin Hubble from the Mount Wilson Observatory's  100-inch Hooker Telescope, once the world's most powerful, was carried into orbit by  the shuttle that launched the space telescope honoring him, a symbolic gesture from  astronomy's past to its future.
Using the Hooker telescope, Hubble was the first to  determine the distance to a galaxy outside the Milky Way.
This provided evidence for  the concept that the universe is expanding.
His work helped convince scientists that the  universe was created in a giant explosion, called the "big bang."
The Hooker Telescope  was mothballed in 1985.
