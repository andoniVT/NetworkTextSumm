Soviet physicists at Moscow's prestigious Lebedev Institute voted 1543 to 22 in secret  ballot Friday to nominate 1975 Nobel Peace Prize winner Andrei D. Sakharov to  parliament, two days after the Academy of Sciences rejected him and other reformers as  candidates.
Whether 67-year-old Sakharov's name will appear on the March 26 ballot is  uncertain.
Sakharov outlined his reform plan for freedom of movement and association, a  multiparty system, a publicly-controlled KGB, and the convergence of communism and  capitalism.
Sakharov publicly supports Gorbachev but is concerned with slow, uneven   reforms.
He acted as unofficial envoy to the Transcaucasus last month, and called for the  release of imprisoned Karabakh Committee members.
