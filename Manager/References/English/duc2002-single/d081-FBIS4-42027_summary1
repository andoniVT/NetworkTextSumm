Ukrainian coal miners at the coal production association and at three pits, went on strike  demanding payment of wage arrears.
A total of 1200 of the association's 2248 workers  are on strike.
Workers at another mine refused to start work on their shifts until the  mine's director assured them the arrears would be paid.
Some members are also  demanding the dismissal of the association's director general.
In the opinion of one  mine's representative, the strike has a clear political hue to compromise the existing  authorities, particularly President Kravchuk, before the second round of presidential  elections.
