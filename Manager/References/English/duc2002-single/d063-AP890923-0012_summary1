Ten men were killed yesterday when an explosion destroyed a  barracks that housed the  Royal Marines School of Music.
The IRA claimed responsibility for the attack.
British  Prime Minister Thatcher denounced the attack.
Irish Prime Minister Haughey also  condemned the attack, and sent Mrs. Thatcher a message of sympathy.
The Music School at Deal is one of 30 military establishments that use private security  firms.
Outraged Britons allege that the School offered an easy target for the IRA.
Opposition party leaders criticized the "penny-pinching policy" that puts military  personnel at a higher risk of danger.
