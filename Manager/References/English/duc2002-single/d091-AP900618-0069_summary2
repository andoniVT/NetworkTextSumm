The death toll from last week's floods reached 21 today when a body was pulled from the  Ohio River.
Hope is fading that the 14 people still listed as missing are alive.
The search  for the missing was suspended briefly this morning when rain fell for about 45 minutes,  swelling Wegee Creek, one of the two creeks that overflowed in Thursday night's flash  flood.
Few people in the area carried flood insurance, and homeowners' insurance will not  cover the flood damage.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency will open an  office Tuesday in Shadyside to accept application for low-interest loans and grants.
