Lucille Ball was mourned Wednesday in her western New York hometown she left more  than 50 years ago.
Miss Ball died earlier in Los Angeles.
Pauline Lopus recalled that  Miss Ball dreamed of fame, worked as an amusement park barker at age 15, and appeared  in school plays.
After becoming a model, Miss Ball moved to Hollywood in 1933.
She  kept contacts in Jamestown and was going to visit on May 20 to receive an honorary  degree from the community college and have a street renamed for her in nearby Celoron,  where she grew up.
These honors now will be awarded posthumously.
