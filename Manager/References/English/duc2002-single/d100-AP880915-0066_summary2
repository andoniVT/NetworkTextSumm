A biography, The Lives of John Lennon, by Albert Goldman portrays the late Beatle as a violent, anorexic, bisexual, drug-addicted drunk.
Lennon's widow, the normally reclusive Yoko Ono, has called the work "totally fiction" in her first broadcast comments on the book.
Goldman calls Ono a gold-digger who snorted heroin and who was responsible for Paul McCartney's 1980 marijuana bust in Japan.
Ono acknowledged having a heroin problem during the late 1970s, but denied Goldman's assertion that it was a $5,000-a-week habit.
Ono's interview was taped at the same New York apartment (at the Dakorta) where she and Lennon lived.
