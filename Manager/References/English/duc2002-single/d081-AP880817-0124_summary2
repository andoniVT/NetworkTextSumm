Port workers in Szczecin and miners at the Morcinek mine declared sympathy strikes in support  of strikers at the nearby July Manifesto mine in Jastrzebie who are demanding the legalization of  Solidarity and raised pay wages.
The strikes mark the eighth anniversary of the birth of  Solidarity, which Communist authorities crushed in 1989.
Miners, who earn nearly twice the average national salary, base their wage demands on hardships  caused by Poland's worsening economy.
