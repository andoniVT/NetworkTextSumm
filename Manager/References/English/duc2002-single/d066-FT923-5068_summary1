"Made in America: My Story" is Sam Walton autobiography and tells how he negotiated  the pitfalls of being America's richest entrepreneur and a folk hero.
Walton, who died of  cancer in April, was a dull, happily married, folksy, quail hunter.
Some question  Walton's anti-union policies, the impact of Wal-Mart on Mom and Pop stores, and  exploits of his children, but his book is all about "good ole" common sense and  anecdotes.
He presents himself as an energetic, competitive, engaging, if one- dimensional, character.
Publishers paid $4 million for him to have his final say.
Some  may find it dreary and downbeat.
