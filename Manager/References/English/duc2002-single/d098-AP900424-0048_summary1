Five astronauts boarded Discovery today preparing to send the Hubble Space  Telescope (HST) into orbit at an altitude of 380 miles.
The day after launch one of the  astronauts will use the shuttle's mechanical arm to  lift the 24,250 pound telescope into  space.
Then Discovery will follow the HST at a distance of 40 miles until its lens cap is  opened.
The HST will not  provide scientific data for a month or so after liftoff, but  NASA plans to release its first image next week.
HST will provide astronomers with 10  times better resolution and 25 times more sensitivity than ground-based observatories.
