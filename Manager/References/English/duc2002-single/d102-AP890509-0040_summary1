Thousands of fans of Lucille Ball attended memorial services in three cities on Monday.
She had died on April 26.
More than 1,000 packed St. Monica's Catholic Church, where  fans had lined up as much as four hours early.
Rev.
Robert Schuller asked the crowd to  "applaud the Lord for Lucille Ball."
Diane Sawyer spoke at the service held at St.  Ignatius Loyola Catholic Church in New York City, which also drew about 1,000 people.
In Chicago, 200 gathered at Old St. Patrick Church.
The family scheduled the services  for 8 p.m. Monday, the time most Americans had watched many of her shows.
