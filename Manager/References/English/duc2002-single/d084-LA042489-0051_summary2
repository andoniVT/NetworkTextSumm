The battleship Iowa was welcomed back to Norfolk Naval Base on Sunday by 3000 silent  family and friends.
Sailors with black arm bands lined the rails.
Two of the 11 crew  members who survived the explosion that killed 47 stood on the blackened No.2 turret,  with full crews on the other two.
Media were kept from families and crew.
A video of the  explosion was released on Sunday.
The still-open gun breech, and flame and gases  reaching lower decks, suggest the explosion occurred while powder was in transit from a  powder hoist to the gun.
The four battleships will stay in service.
