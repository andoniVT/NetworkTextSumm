Virginia Thomas, wife of Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas, who shares her  husband's conservative viewpoint, has her own critics.
Some women's rights activists  are upset by her lobbying against comparable worth legislation and religious-rights  groups are troubled by her anti-cult activities following her involvement with Lifespring,  a motivational group.
The fact that she is white has drawn criticism from some blacks  who see her as evidence that Thomas has rejected his roots.
Virginia has represented the  conservative viewpoint in jobs as staffer for a Republican congressman, spokesperson at  the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and deputy assistant secretary at the Department of  Labor.
