Navy spokesman Lt. Cmdr.
Alan Dooley said Sunday that it could take months before the  investigation into the cause of the explosion that killed 47 aboard the battleship USS  Iowa is completed and the results made public.
A seven-member team of investigators  boarded the battleship a day after the Wednesday explosion in the battleship's No.
2 gun  turret.
The Navy won't speculate on the cause of the explosion, but Sunday's New York Times  cited unidentified sources saying that it occurred while the 550-pound propellant bags  were being loaded into the gun.
Eleven survivors inside the turret were all loading  powder.
