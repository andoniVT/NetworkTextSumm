Indian border guards fired on hundreds of Pakistanis who tried to cross a cease-fire line separating the Pakistan-controlled part of Kashmir from that held by India.
Pakistani troops then fired on the Indian security forces.
No one was hurt in the exchange.
A fluid 840-mile cease-fire line separates the Indian and Pakistan parts of Kashmir.
The conflict over Kashmir flared January 20th after a government crackdown and arrest of 250 suspected militants.
They were soon released; however, the arrests sparked the violence.
The majority of the 85 people killed in the violence have been protesters shot by security forces.
