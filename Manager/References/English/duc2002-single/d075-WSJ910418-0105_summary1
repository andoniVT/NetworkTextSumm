An experiment indicates that a blood and urine test of individuals with high blood  pressure can pinpoint those patients most likely to have a heart attack.
The test also can  determine those patients whose risk of heart attack is extremely low.
The test determines  whether the kidneys are releasing too much renin into the blood.
People with high levels  of rennin are at a high risk of heart attack.
The test can be especially useful for  determining heart attack risks in patients without any of the usual risk factors.
Those in  this group with high rennin levels were seven times more likely to suffer a heart attack.
