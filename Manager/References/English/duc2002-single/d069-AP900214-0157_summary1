The Chairman of the Simon Wisenthal Center, Rabbi Marvin Hier, wrote to West  German Chancellor Kohl and East German Premier Modrow.
The Center, based in Los  Angeles, was founded by Hier to keep alive the memory of the Nazi persecution of Jews  in Germany and Nazi-occupied countries.
Hier asked to meet with Kohl when he is in Washington, and with Modrow in Germany  next month.
He says that the victims of Nazism have great and legitimate fear of German  reunification, and listed actions that should be taken to allay that fear.
