A study found that if heart attack victims quickly receive clot-dissolving drugs, they  usually don't need the extra step of a common balloon procedure, known as angioplasty.
The clot-dissolving factor known as TPA, dramatically improved the survival chances of  heart attack victims.
When groups who underwent angioplasty were compared to groups  who received TPA and only those with lingering heart pain or other symptoms underwent  angioplasty, there was no difference in survival rates.
The results mean that most patients  can be treated in community hospitals where angioplasty is not available and that the  nation could save $704 million in medical bills.
