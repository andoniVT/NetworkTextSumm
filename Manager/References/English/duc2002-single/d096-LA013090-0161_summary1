Super Bowl XXIV was the most watched TV event of the week, viewed by 63% of the viewers.
CBS estimates 109 million viewers, down only 2 million from last year, despite the fact that this  year's match was a blowout and resulted in the lowest rating since Super Bowl III in 1969.
Each rating point in 1990, however, represents many more households than it did two decades  ago.
Technically, Super Bowl IV in 1970 out rated Super Bowl XXIV 39.4 to 39.0.
But  Sunday's game had almost twice the estimated 59.19 million who watched Kansas City beat  Minnesota 20 years ago.
