Aspirin can be a significant factor in reducing the number of heart attacks.
Taking a  single aspirin every other day could cut the risk of a heart attack in half.
When used with  a clot-dissolving drug, given within 24 hours of a heart attack, the chance of a second  heart attack is reduced from 13 percent to 8 percent.
Many doctors still are not using  clot-dissolving drugs but it is felt that, in the future, their use will be considered safe  enough to allow paramedics to administer them to patients on the way to the hospital.
Using a clot dissolver and aspirin could save 25,000 lives a year.
