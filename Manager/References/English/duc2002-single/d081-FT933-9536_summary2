Coal miners from Romania's Jiu Valley who led anti-reform rampages through Bucharest in  1990 and 1991 are again on strike.
The government has not caved in and has begun legal action  to have the strike declared illegal.
The miners' position seems untenable.
Romanians are  opposed to the miners' wage demand, the mines are not considered a vital source of energy, and  the miners are in danger of pricing their coal out of the market.
The miners want more money to compensate for difficult living and working conditions.
They  also are following Miron Cosma, their charismatic leader who secured their earlier wage  increases.
