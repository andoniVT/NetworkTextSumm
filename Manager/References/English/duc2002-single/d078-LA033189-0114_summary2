This year's Academy Awards ceremonies opened with an elaborate, 10-minute Snow  White song-and-dance routine, without Disney's permission.
The Academy of Motion  Picture Arts and Sciences told Disney only that the program contained no material  deleterious to Disney interests.
Disney sued for copyright infringement when the  academy refused to publicly apologize for unauthorized use of the Disney character.
Ironically, the academy closely protects the Oscar's copyrighted name and image.
The  Snow White character portrayed Wednesday night was created by Steve Silver, who has  used the character in the San Francisco musical revue "Beach Blanket Babylon" for 15  years.
Disney has never sued Silver but didn't rule out the possibility.
