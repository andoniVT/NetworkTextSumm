A leader of the Moslem separatist movement, the Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front, was  killed by police gunfire in downtown Srinagar on Friday.
Police said he was trying to  throw a grenade from a motorcycle into a police bunker.
Later, 40,000 people gathered  for a funeral procession, which was prevented by police and soldiers.
Mourners at the  graveside vowed to carry on his fight for the independence of Jammu-Kashmir from  India.
India and Pakistan have fought two wars over Kashmir, which was split between  the nations.
Jammu-Kashmir is India's only Moslem-majority state.
At least 233 have  been killed here since January 20.
