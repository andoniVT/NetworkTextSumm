The Booker Prize, Britain's literary event of the year is guaranteed to boost sales of the chosen  novel.
The winning author receives a check for #20,000 ($38,000) sponsored by Booker, an  international food and agriculture business.
Book Trust, a charity promoting reading and books,  administers the prize.
British publishers submit three new novels by British and Commonwealth writers.
A  management committee of authors, booksellers, librarians, and the sponsors choose a jury of  five: a writer and/or an academic, politician, editor or critic.
Each juror reads every book and  meets with other jurists to select six finalists.
