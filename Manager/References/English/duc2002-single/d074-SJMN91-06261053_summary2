Clarence Thomas completed five grueling days of Senate questioning apparently well on  his way to becoming the second black justice in the history of the Supreme Court.
Several committee members said that they expected the committee to recommend by a  10-4 or 9-5 vote, to confirm.
Several liberal Democrats accused Thomas of being evasive  and of disavowing many statements he made while an official of the Reagan and Bush  administrations.
The American Bar Association evaluation committee told the senators  that Thomas' articles were deficient in presentation, content, scholarship and analysis.
But those limitations were outweighed by his performance on the Court of Appeals.
