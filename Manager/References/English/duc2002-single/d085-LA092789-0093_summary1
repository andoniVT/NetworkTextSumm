State Farm and Nationwide, the two dominant insurers in the Carolinas, expect $600  million in claims from Hurricane Hugo, making it the most expensive storm ever for the  insurance industry.
Property damage escalated because Hugo scored a direct hit on  Charleston and then veered northwest.
Overall claims will exceed the record $752.5  million after Hurricane Frederic in 1979.
Reinsurers, who share risk in exchange for part  of the premiums, and spread their own risk over many companies, will pick up much of  the costs.
The billions paid out this year because of Hugo and other catastrophes will  cause insurance firms to raise prices -- good news for companies and shareholders.
