Exotic Kashmir has become a war zone where Moslem separatists are seeking  independence from predominately Hindu India.
At least 72 people have been killed since  the first of the year.
The 24-hour curfew in Srinagar was lifted briefly on Monday so  people could shop.
Electricity was turned off on Friday, the Moslem Sabbath, to silence  the mosques' loudspeakers.
The governor of Jammu-Kashmir claims only a "handful of  terrorists" are fighting, but others say the situation is critical.
Kashmir, predominately  Moslem, was divided between India and Moslem Pakistan in 1947.
India claims Pakistan  is training and arming the separatists; Pakistan denies this.
