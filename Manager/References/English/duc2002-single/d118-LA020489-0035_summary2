A Senate Armed Services committee vote to approve former Senator John Tower as Secretary of  Defense was cancelled Thursday following allegations of recent drinking problems as will as  inappropriate behavior with women.
The FBI is looking into the matter and the results of their  investigation are not expected until Tuesday.
Tower stated that he limited his drinking to an  occasional glass of wine.
Staff members also reported that recently he has been ordering only  tonic water with his meals.
Tower's work with defense contractors also raised questions with the  committee but did not appear to threaten his nomination.
