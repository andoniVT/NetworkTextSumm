The San Francisco 49ers won the Super Bowl Sunday with a dramatic 20-16 victory over the  Cincinnati Bengals.
Joe Montana's 10-yard touchdown pass to John Taylor with 34 seconds  remaining provided the win.
The pass gave Montana a Super Bowl record with 357 yards  passing.
The victory was achieved through the brilliance of  Montana and Jerry Rice, the wide  receiver who caught 12 passes for 222 yards, both Super Bowl records.
Rice was named the  game's most valuable player.
It was the fifth straight win for a National Football Conference team and the third Super Bowl  win for Coach Bill Walsh.
