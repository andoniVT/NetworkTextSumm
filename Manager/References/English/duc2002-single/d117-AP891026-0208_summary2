Japanese writer Kazuo Ishiguro won the 1989 Booker Prize, Britain's top literary award, for his  novel, "The Remains of the Day", a love story about a butler's English vacation.
It explores the  vexed themes of class, tradition, and duty.
Ishiguro, 39, arrived in England at age 6 and now  lives in south London.
He was a finalist for the Booker Prize in 1986.
After receiving the prize, Ishiguro paid tribute to Salmon Rushdie, the 1988 runner-up for the  award, who went into hiding in February when threatened with death by Moslems who said his  novel, "The Satanic Verses" blasphemed their faith.
