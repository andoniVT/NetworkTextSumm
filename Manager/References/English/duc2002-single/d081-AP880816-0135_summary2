More than 4,000 workers at the Manifest Lipcowy coalmine in Jastrzebie southwest of Warsaw  went on strike today to demand legalization of Solidarity and higher wages.
Solidarity was  formed around Gdansk eight years before when factory and shipyard workers united to form the  only independent trade federation in the Soviet bloc.
It was crushed in 1981.
Manifest Lipcowy is the second mine in the industrial region of Silesia to experience unrest.
Workers at the Rudna copper mine near Wroclaw staged a protest rally Monday to demand  improved safety conditions and the return to work of Solidarity activists barred Saturday from  working.
