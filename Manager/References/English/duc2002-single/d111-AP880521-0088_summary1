Greek divers have found the remains of a Turkish warship, the Bourloti Seimaz, in the eastern Aegean near the island of Chios.
Greek revolutionaries had sunk the ship in 1822 in revenge for Turkish killing and looting on Chios.
Thousands died in Chios and this action put European countries behind the Greek struggle for independence from the Ottoman Empire, which they won in 1830.
The Greeks had rammed the Turkish ship with a boatload of explosives.
The Greeks escaped the explosion that killed the Ottoman commander.
The remains of the ship lie under 162 feet of water making recovery difficult.
