Paying unexpected calls on Wal-Mart stores is one way Chairman Sam Walton has kept  in touch with everyday happenings.
Other Wal-Mart executives follow his example.
Walton's personality permeates operations and his whole family is in the business.
People say Sam is as old-fashioned and homespun as his principles, which declare the  customer is always right.
He is happy to chat with customers, but shuns the press  especially when asked about his massive fortune.
Walton turns 71 in March.
He was  born in Oklahoma, the son of a mortgage banker.
He opened Wal-Mart Discount City in  1962.
The rest is history.
