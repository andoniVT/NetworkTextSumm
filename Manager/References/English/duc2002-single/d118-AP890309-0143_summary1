The Democrat-controlled Senate rejected the nomination of former Texas Senator John Tower to be Secretary of Defense on a 53-47 vote.
The rejection came after a bitter debate that focused on Tower's drinking habits, womanizing, and business dealings with defense contractors.
Kansas GOP Senator Nancy Kassebaum was the only Republican to oppose Tower.
Three Democrats had voted for Tower.
After the voting, Tower called Senator John Warner and asked him to thank those who had supported him.
Majority Leader George Mitchell moved to repair relations between the Senate and President that had been damaged during the debate.
