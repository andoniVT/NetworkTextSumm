Residents of Lucille Ball's hometown, Jamestown N.Y., remembered the star on  Wednesday, following her death in Los Angeles.
She had starred in high school plays  and appeared on the vaudeville stage.
Although Miss Ball had not been to Jamestown  since 1956, she maintained friends and donated money to charities and civic events.
After she became ill, the town sent her 150 posters with 10,000 signatures.
She was to  have been honored on May 20 with an honorary degree from the community college and  a street renamed Lucy Lane in the village where she was raised.
The honors will now be  awarded posthumously.
