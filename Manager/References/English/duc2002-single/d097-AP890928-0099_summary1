In March 1778, after the British torched Kingston, then the New York capital,  South Carolina Gov.
Livingston sent New York Gov.
George Clinton 1,000 New  York pounds with a letter saying, "This money has been received for the charitable  purpose of alleviating the distresses of the now-indigent inhabitants of the town of  Kingston."
Kingston Historian Edwin Ford remembered the letter when  Hurricane Hugo struck the Carolinas last week, and on Wednesday a local Red  Cross chapter began collecting donations.
New York State is also airlifting relief supplies to the Caribbean and Puerto Rico  which were also hard hit by Hugo.
