Hurricane Gilbert swept toward Jamaica yesterday with 100 mph winds, and officials  issued warnings to residents on the southern coasts of the Dominican Republic, Haiti and  Cuba.
Hal Gerrish, with the National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla., said, "It's  still gaining strength.
It's certainly one of the larger systems we've seen in the Caribbean  for a long time.'
The governments of Haiti, Cuba and Jamaica issued warnings.
In  Puerto Rico, the storm injured three people, tore off several roofs, caused coastal flooding  and brought down trees and power lines in the west and southwest regions.
