Two Swiss trusts, a private UK trust company and a US investment bank are under investigation  by the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) for involvement in an illegal scheme to support the Maxwell  Communication Corporation (MCC) share price.
Robert Maxwell and his son Kevin, the owners  of MCC, are being investigated by SFO for failure to disclose purchases of shares by Swiss  Trusts as required by company law.
A directive of a secretive Swiss trust said the purchases, using brokers, had been "going on for  some time" and were bought for other "foundations" and then held for a certain time.
