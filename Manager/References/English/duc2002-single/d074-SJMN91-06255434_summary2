Virginia Thomas, wife of Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas shares her  husband's conservative views.
She represented the conservative viewpoint in her jobs as  a staffer for a Republican congressman, spokeswoman for the U.S. Chamber of  Commerce and deputy assistant secretary at the Department of Labor.
Her opposition to comparable worth legislation upsets some women's rights groups and  some religious groups are troubled by her anti-cult activities.
She is involved with the  Cult Awareness Network, which educates the public about "destructive" cults.
Some  blacks view the fact that she is white as evidence that Clarence Thomas has rejected his  roots.
