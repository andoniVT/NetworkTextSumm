The nation's two largest brewers, Anheuser Busch Cos., Inc. and Miller Brewing Co., are  gearing up to sell their beer by staging mock football games in television commercials in  conjunction with Super Bowl XXIV.
Attempting to take advantage of weeks of hype, both  companies will spend upwards of $7 million.
Anheuser Busch's "Bud Bowl II" ad campaign will feature animated teams of Budweiser and  Bud Light beer bottles rattling around on a pint-sized football field.
Miller's 12-week pre-Super Bowl campaign will center on a football game between a "Tastes  Great" team and a "Less Filling" squad featuring NFL players.
