Relatives and friends of Republican Vice Presidential candidate Dan Quayle do not believe that his candidacy will have an adverse effect on his family life.
Quayle and his wife are devoted to their three children and remain close to many of their friends during the period that the 41-year old senator has been in public life.
Both Quayle's and his wife's roots are in Indiana.
After law school, he worked in the Indiana attorney general's office.
The Quayles have worried about the family's loss of privacy during the campaign.
Their three children were two to one in favor of Quayle's accepting the VP spot if offered.
