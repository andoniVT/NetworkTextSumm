Retired Adm. Eugene LaRocque of the Center for Defense Information said Thursday  that the 16-inch guns on the Iowa, which can fire a 2,700 pound shell a distance of 20  miles are "old-fashioned and inherently dangerous."
The main criticism is that six 110- pound silk bags of gunpowder are required to fire the projectile.
Hot debris may remain  or explosive gases can build up in the barrel, igniting powder before the breech is closed.
Capt.
Larry Seaquist, former commander of the Iowa, defended the gun, saying it is  "[the] finest naval gun in the world and it is still a front-line system."
