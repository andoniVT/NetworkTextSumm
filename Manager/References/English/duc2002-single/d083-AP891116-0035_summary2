On Wednesday, a deadly tornado slammed into Huntsville, Alabama.
It smashed into a  shopping district, a residential area and a school, killing at least 15 people, injuring more  than 300 and trapping people in their cars and homes.
"It's total destruction where the  tornado hit," said Danny Cooper, state emergency management director.
Rescue teams  with cranes and floodlights searched the rubble through the night for injured or dead.
Governor Guy Hunt said, "It may be tomorrow before we have a final count."
Tornadoes  were also reported elsewhere in Alabama, in North Carolina, Kentucky, Mississippi and  25 miles outside of Atlanta, Georgia.
