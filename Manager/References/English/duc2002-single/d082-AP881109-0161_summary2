Human rights activist Andrei D. Sakharov began a two-week US visit Sunday.
He will  visit relatives, undergo medical tests, and promote the new International Foundation for  Survival and Development of Humanity, to which he belongs.
Sakharov helped form the  1970s Soviet dissident movement, won the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize, and was exiled  internally for seven years after criticizing Soviet occupation of Afghanistan.
Gorbachev  allowed him to return to Moscow in December 1986.
Some of Sakharov's statements  have since appeared in press, including his opposition to some elements of Gorbachev  reforms and to Reagan's Star Wars program.
His presentation of 200 political prisoners'  names and his US visit went unreported.
