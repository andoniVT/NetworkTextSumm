Spike Lee, in a lecture and question-and-answer session Monday at Syracuse University,  shrugged off the icy treatment of his latest movie by the Academy Award voters.
Widely  hailed by critics, the 1989 film "Do the Right Thing," received only two Academy Award  nominations and was not recommended for best picture or best director.
Lee commented  that the academy's membership consists mainly of "old people" more comfortable with  the black chauffeur in "Driving Miss Daisy" than with the angry characters in his film.
The students warmly welcomed Lee.
As one student said, "He's an African  American" and he's addressing the issues "affecting our community."
