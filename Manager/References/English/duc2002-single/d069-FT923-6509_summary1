The Bundesbank, West Germany's Central Bank, is being criticized for its refusal to  lower interest rates to help the German economy.
It is apparent to the government that   reunification needs a strong growing West Germany economy to finance the  subsidization of the woeful living conditions of the East Germans until there is a  sustained upswing in the East.
The chief economist of the Bundesbank sees no reason to cut Germany's interest rates.
The governments and central banks of Europe should make him realize that a low interest  rate reunification boom is necessary to the European economy.
