The annual Booker ballyhoo got going yesterday when the judges for this year's #20,000 prize  for British (and Commonwealth) fiction announced the shortlist.
The prize is no longer the  richest literary award but it guarantees great prestige and sales for the winner and brings the  novel to public attention.
Critics say the brouhaha distorts the annual fiction industry and the intense media hype of the  shortlisted authors does a disservice to other gifted but unlisted authors.
For weeks, London's  literati have been betting on Michael Ondaatje's "The English Patient" and last night the  bookmakers made it the 5-2 favorite.
