Iranian news media reacted sluggishly Thursday to an earthquake that left 25,000 dead  in northern Iran.
For hours the only detailed reporting by the Islamic Republic News  Agency (IRNA) was that Tehran residents were either asleep or watching a World Cup  soccer match when the quake hit.
IRNA also underestimated the severity of the quake  reporting 10,000 dead late Thursday while the Iranian ambassador to the United  Nations said 25,000 had died.
Official radio was off  the air when the quake hit and only  reported the earthquake 6.5 hours later.
Like IRNA radio reporting lacked color and  description for hours.
