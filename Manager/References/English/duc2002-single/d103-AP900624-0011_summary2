On Sunday an anti-American newspaper in Iran blamed the United States for  tens of  thousands of deaths in last week's earthquake, claiming that because of the U.S.'s  plundering of Iran's oil and other resources for 25 years, Iran's national wealth was not  applied to development of  "advanced (anti-seismic) building construction systems."
Later the U.S. imposed economic sanctions and launched "several other plots" that  halted the renovation of the country.
The paper called for rejection of relief offers by the  U.S. and "other governments whose hands are stained with the blood of the Iranian  people."
Iran has said it would welcome relief from U.S. humanitarian groups.
