She died at the age of 77, at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center following emergency  heart surgery.
Miss Ball and her late former husband, Desi Arnaz, starred in "I Love  Lucy", from 1951 to 1957.
The groundbreaking show, still seen in syndication  worldwide, was one of the most popular in television.
Her admirers included President  Bush and former President Reagan as well as many famous comedians.
