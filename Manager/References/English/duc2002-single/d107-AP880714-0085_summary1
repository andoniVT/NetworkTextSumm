The National Weather Service said yesterday that major grain-growing states had a 55- 60% chance of weather hotter and drier than normal over the next month.
Southern and  coastal California would also be dry.
The Southeast, Southwest, and Northwest would be  wetter than normal.
The Agriculture Department forecast sharp crop declines.
NOAA  said dry spells have no normal lifetime, but statistical analysis of past droughts suggests  many areas have less than a 4% chance of recovering in the next three months.
At June's  end, 29% of the continental US experienced severe drought.
The current drought equals   1911's, but is less severe than droughts in 1931, 1934, 1936, and 1956.
