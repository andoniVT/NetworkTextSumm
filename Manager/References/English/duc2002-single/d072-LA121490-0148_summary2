Carol Lawrence, the original Maria of "West Side Story," sang as did cast members from  other Bernstein shows, including Nancy Walker, Betty Comden, and Adolph Green ("On  the Town") and Barabara Cook ("Candide").
Lauren Bacall, Phyllis Newman, and Kurt  Ollman also performed.
The program finale, "Somewhere," sung by Marilyn Horne was  followed by a sustained standing ovation for "Lenny."
