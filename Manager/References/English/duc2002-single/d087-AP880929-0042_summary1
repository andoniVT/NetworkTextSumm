Florence Griffith Joyner, 28, of Los Angeles, known for her long fingernails and colorful  bodysuits, set an Olympic record Sunday in winning the 100-meter sprint.
In Thursday's  200-meter race, she dashed to her second gold in 21.34 seconds, shattering the world  mark she had set 90 minutes earlier in her semifinal heat.
She is scheduled to run the  400-meter relay on Saturday and may compete in the 1600-meter relay that day.
Griffith  Joyner has a chance to match the 1984 quadruple gold medal performance of U.S.  sprinter and long jumper Carl Lewis, and by Fanny Blanker-Koen of the Netherlands in  1948.
