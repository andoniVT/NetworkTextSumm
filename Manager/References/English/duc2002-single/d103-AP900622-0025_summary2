The earthquake that struck northern Iran Thursday resembled the Armenian earthquake  of Dec. 7, 1988.
Both killed about 25,000 people most of whom died as their fragile  homes collapsed.
The Iranian quake was the stronger measuring 7.7 (vs. 6.9) on the  Richter scale.
The Iranian quake occurred just after midnight, so most people were  inside asleep when it hit.
It occurred in an area where most of the adobe buildings are  on a flood plain of loosely deposited soil that shifts causing structures to collapse.
Thursday's quake was the strongest ever recorded in that area where two major plates  of the earth's crust meet.
