Doctors should be cautious in prescribing aspirin to prevent heart attacks until more  research supports its value.
Studies do indicate that aspirin reduces the risk of first non- fatal heart attacks, by reducing the ability of blood platelets to form clots.
But for people  who have clotting problems or have high blood pressure aspirin may increase the risk for  hemorrhagic stroke.
In one study, there were 10 hemorrhagic strokes recorded among the  11,000 subjects taking aspirin, compared with 2 strokes in the 11,000 taking a substitute.
Overall death rates for the two groups were similar, though the aspirin non-fatal heart  attack rate was much lower.
