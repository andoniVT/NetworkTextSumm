A large family group was permitted to visit Nelson Mandela in prison on his 71st birthday.
Mandela's wife, Winnie, and several of his children, grandchildren, a daughter-in-law and a great-grandson comprised the group.
There had been speculation that Mandela would be released from prison, especially after a summer meeting with President P, W. Botha.
Mandela told his wife that the meeting should not be interpreted as leading to his release.
Mandela has been in prison since 1962 when he was sentenced to five years.
He was then given a life sentence in 1964 for sabotage and plotting to overthrow the government.
