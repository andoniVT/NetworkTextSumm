An Argentine corvette carried out control operations against a Korean vessel illegally fishing in Argentine waters.
The Foreign Ministry approved the intervention as being in accordance with priority to be given to preserve marine life resources and punishing violators of national laws.
The Korean crew sank its own ship after it failed to answer the Argentine ship's warnings.
Another Korean ship nearby rescued the crew of the sinking ship.
The incident occurred about 15 nautical miles off the coast of Malvinas so the Argentine ship transferred assistance responsibility to British authorities in accordance with bilateral agreements.
