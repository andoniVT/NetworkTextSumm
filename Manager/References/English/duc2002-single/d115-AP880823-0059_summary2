Rain in the India-Nepal border region where a major earthquake struck Sunday is  hampering rescue efforts.
Landslides block many roads, railroad tracks are sunk in mud,  and bridges over rain swollen rivers are cracked.
Officials in Nepal say more than 497  people died.
Authorities in India report 200 deaths in Bihar, but news reports say 400  died.
Officials in both countries expect the death toll to climb once reports arrive from  remote regions.
In Biratnagar, a Nepalese city near the Indian border, in Katmandu and in Patna, India  rumors of another earthquake sent thousands of residents into open areas.
