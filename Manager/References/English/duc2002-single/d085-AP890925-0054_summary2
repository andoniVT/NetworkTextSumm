The mayors of Charleston and North Charleston, S.C. gave credit to residents of  their cities for the low fatality rate from Hurricane Hugo which hit the city  with full force.
Although the hurricane claimed 17 lives in South Carolina,  Charleston, which took the brunt of the storm, lost only two.
The residents  heard the warnings of forecasters and officials and took action upon them.
18,000 residents of Charleston and the three surrounding counties headed for  shelters.
Tens of thousands more got into their cars and headed inland.
All of  these potential victims saved themselves.
