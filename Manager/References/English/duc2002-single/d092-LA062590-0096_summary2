Orange County's Iranian community, which numbers from 60,000 to 80,000, hoped to raise a half million dollars for relief of earthquake ravaged Iran.
Responses also came from the 150 Iranian doctors practicing in the county who donated medicine and medical supplies.
The Red Cross was accepting only cash donations because of shipping costs.
Estimates of the number killed in the earthquake have risen to 50,000 and an additional 200,000 injured.
Rescue efforts were hampered by a strong aftershock in the region 120 miles northwest of Tehran.
The new aftershock, with magnitude 5.7, toppled remaining buildings and caused mudslides that temporarily closed roads.
