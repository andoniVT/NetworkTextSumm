The Iranian community of Orange County, California launched an effort Sunday to  collect half a million dollars in money, medicine, tents, blankets and sleeping bags for  hundreds of thousands of injured and homeless victims of the earthquake in  northwestern Iran.
Between 60,000 and 80,000 Iranians live in Orange County and 150  Iranian doctors practicing there responded to calls for medical supplies.
In Iran rescue  efforts suffered a setback Sunday as the strongest aftershock yet with a magnitude of  5.7 hit the rice-growing region of Rasht causing mudslides that temporarily closed off an  important relief route.
Estimated casualties have now reached 50,000 killed and  200,000 injured.
