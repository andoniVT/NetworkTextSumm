In Japan, Emperor Hirohito was simply called Tenno Heika, meaning His Majesty The  Emperor.
After his death he was posthumously named Showa, the name he chose for his reign soon  after he became emperor in 1926.
It means Enlightened Peace, and has been succeeded  by Heisei, or Achieving Peace, the name the government chose for the reign of Hirohito's  son Akihito a few hours after the emperor died on Jan. 7.
In Japan, years are numbered according to the emperor's tenure on the throne.
Thus, 1926  was Showa 1 and 1989 was Showa 64 until Hirohito's death.
Now this year is Heisei 1.
