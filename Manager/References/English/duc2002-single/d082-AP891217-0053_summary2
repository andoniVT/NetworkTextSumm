45,000 grievers filed past the body of Andrei D. Sakharov -- physicist, Nobel Peace Prize  winner, human rights advocate, legislator, and his country's conscience.
Sakharov, 68,  died Thursday of an apparent heart attack.
Sunday began two days of memorial  ceremonies.
Moscow News published a special edition devoted to the activist, including  a speech he delivered hours before his death saying the Soviet hierarchy was leading the  country to catastrophe.
Pravda published a virtual public apology to Sakharov, once  ostracized and exiled.
Sakharov had two children from his first marriage; two with his  widow Yelena Bonner, who was his constant companion and fellow human rights  activist; and four grandchildren.
