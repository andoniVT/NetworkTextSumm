Mikail Gorbachev proposed tougher legislation to punish Soviets who kindle ethnic unrest, saying "nationalist passions" benefit opponents of his reforms.
State-run media indicated that a crackdown had begun against the people of Armenia who continue to agitate for annexation of a mostly Armenian enclave in the neighboring republic of Azerbaijan.
The six-month conflict between the two republics over the Nagorno- Karabakh district has let to ethnic violence.
Gorbachev said the grounds for tougher legislation come from the Soviet constitution, which says it is unlawful to advocate "racial or national exclusiveness, hostility or contempt".
Gorbachev made other proposals to increase power for each of the 15 republics.
