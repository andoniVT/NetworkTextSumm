Pathology exams  requested by the Navy have begun at Dover AFB on the sailors killed  in an explosion aboard the battleship Iowa.
Afterward, the sailors are being sent to their  hometowns for burial.
Crew on the Navy's three other battleships particularly felt the loss  of comrades, as well as a connection with sailors who served on the same ships in WWII.
The Iowa is expected at Norfolk this afternoon.
Six investigators aboard the ship are  searching for clues to the blast.
Crew in upper chambers of the gun turret died instantly in  the explosion, while those in lower levels suffocated as the blast siphoned off oxygen.
