Gail Gordon, Lucille Ball's sidekick through radio and television, said "the world will  miss her greatly."
He said he will remember her as the best talent of her kind and a warm  and wonderful friend.
They first met in 1947 on her radio program "My Favorite  Husband."
He joined her on television from 1962 to 1974.
He last spoke with Miss Ball  on his birthday in February.
Gordon, 81, performs in dinner theatres in Edmonton,  Canada, and regrets that he will not be able to attend her funeral because of obligations to  his current production.
