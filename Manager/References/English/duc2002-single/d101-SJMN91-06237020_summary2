Boris Yeltsin is showing himself to be at least the political equal, if not the master, of Mikhail  Gorbachev.
In a joint appearance in the Russian Parliament, Yeltsin made it clear that  Gorbachev has authority only if agreeing to share power and intensify the march toward  democracy and a market economy.
Yeltsin interrupted Gorbachev's speech and aggressively  announced a decree had been signed suspending the activity of the Russian Communist Party.
Yeltsin later showed Gorbachev the minutes of a Council of Ministers meeting, which showed  his allies had betrayed him.
Gorbachev promptly announced the "whole government has to  resign."
