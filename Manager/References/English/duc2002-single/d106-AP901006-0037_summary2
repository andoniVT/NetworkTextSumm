Unidentified assailants attacked the home of relatives of Nelson Mandela, killing a baby  girl and injuring her parents.
Nelson Mandela was close to the family, was not in the  home at the time of the incident.
Given the family's connection to Mandela, police could  not say if the attack was deliberate or the result of random violence.
Black townships  have been hit by factional fighting between African national Congress members and the  Zulus of the Inkatha group.
Mandela, who was released from prison after 27 years, for  opposing the white South African government is negotiating with President de Klerk to  end apartheid.
