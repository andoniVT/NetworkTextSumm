This week's events in the Soviet Union have Kremlinologists who dabble in conspiracy theories  working overtime.
One said, "Once you have a palace coup, the possibilities are endless."
One  intriguing scenario has Gorbachev hatching a false coup in order to step out of the way while  hard-liners and liberals battle each other.
The coup falls apart and Gorbachev returns to power  stronger than before.
Kremlin watchers said theorizing was fueled by the fact that tanks did not  roll until hours after Gorbachev's arrest, President Yeltsin was not arrested, Leningrad was left  alone and, reportedly, many of the tanks had no ammunition.
