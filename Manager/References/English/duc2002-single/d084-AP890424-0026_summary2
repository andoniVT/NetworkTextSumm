A 7-member team of Navy investigators, including former battleship commander Rear  Adm. Milligan and gunnery experts, will look at possible human or mechanical errors as  causes of the explosion aboard the battleship Iowa that killed 47.
The investigation will  be complex because there were no witnesses.
The explosion damaged only the inside of  the turret.
The gun's breech was open and undamaged with the projectile still present,  indicating the explosion occurred while powder was being transferred from a powder  hoist to the gun.
Flame and hot gases reached the lowest deck, indicating the hoist was  not yet sealed.
A video of the blast was released Sunday.
