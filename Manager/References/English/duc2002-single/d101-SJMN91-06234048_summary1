Kremlinologists who look for conspiracies are working overtime on recent events in the Soviet Union.
The announcement of Gorbachev's illness and a palace coup provides a starting point for speculation.
Could it be that Gorbachev has co-opted the coup?
Tanks did not roll until hours after Gorbachev's supposed arrest and it was said that many of the tanks that surrounded the Parliament building had no ammunition.
Russian President Boris Yeltsin was not arrested.
According to the theory,  Gorbachev did not want any bloodshed.
Even Eduard Shevardnadze, a longtime ally of Gorbachev, considered the possibility that he was behind the activities.
