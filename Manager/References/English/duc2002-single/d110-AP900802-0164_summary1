Iraq says it invaded Kuwait at the request of a revolutionary organization there, but  diplomats worldwide dismiss this rational as a large-scale charade.
The U.N. Security  Council voted 14-0 to condemn the invasion.
Iraq's U.N. representative said the U.N.  should not be involved, the fall of Kuwait was an internal matter.
Meanwhile, a series of  communiques from the "provisional government", whose members were not identified,  came from the Iraqi state-run news agency in Baghdad, not from Kuwait, indicating that  the Iraqis are in charge.
Kuwait is one of the few Arab states that has experimented with  a freely elected parliament.
