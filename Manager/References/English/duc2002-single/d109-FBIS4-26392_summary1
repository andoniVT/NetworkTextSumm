According to the State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters, water levels of  the Xi Jiang, Bei Jiang, Xiang Jiang, and Gan Jiang rivers are dropping.
The Xi Jiang and Bei Jiang, in Guangdong Province, crested yesterday, the Bei Jiang at a  record 10.39 meters.
The industrialized Zhujiang Delta, however, is still threatened  because it is traversed by a merged Xi Jiang and Bei Jiang.
The Xiang Jiang crested on 19 June, but today the water level is still at 25 meters.
Dike  reinforcement, therefore, must be accelerated.
The flood peak in Gan Jiang entered Boyang Lake on 20 June.
