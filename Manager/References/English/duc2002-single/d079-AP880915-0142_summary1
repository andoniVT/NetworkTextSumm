Gilbert, the most intense hurricane ever recorded, surged toward Texas today after  battering the Yucatan Peninsula, leveling homes, pummeling posh resorts and forcing  tens of thousands to flee.
The entire Texas coast and the northeast Mexican coast are on  hurricane watch.
Earlier this week the storm ravaged Jamaica, killing 19 and destroying  about 100,000 of Jamaica's 500,000 homes.
The Dominican Republic, where 5 died, the  Cayman Islands and Haiti were also hit hard.
In Mexico, the cities of Merida, Puerto  Progreso, Campeche, Ciudad el Carmen and Cancun were most affected, as were the  resort islands of Cozumel and Isla Mujeres where 15,000 remain stranded.
