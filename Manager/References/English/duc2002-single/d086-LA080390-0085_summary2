On Thursday President Bush embargoed all trade with Iraq, froze its assets in the U.S.,  and refused to rule out the use of U.S. forces.
The Pentagon stepped up air patrols in  the Persian Gulf and began moving warships into the area.
Kuwait's ambassador to the  U.S. appealed for U.S. intervention and the State Department labeled Iraq's claim of  responding to the request of an "interim free government" in Kuwait as a "patent fraud."
Although Bush has refused to rule out military action, it seems unlikely in view of Iraq's  military strength, the limited U.S. forces nearby and the opposition to U.S. intervention  from other countries in the area.
