With growing numbers of disgruntled East Germans emigrating to West Germany, the  idea of reunification seems possible and is being seriously discussed.
Most West German  officials and President Bush support the idea.
Soviet and East German leaders oppose it,  Honecker much more strongly than Gorbachev.
Throughout the rest of Europe unification  scenarios are being considered and discussed by officials and media commentators.
Recalling Nazi Germany's sordid past, some express a mistrust toward uniting a  Germany that could become Europe's economic powerhouse with almost 80 million  people.
Still others believe we ought not be governed by old prejudices and out-of-date  assumptions.
