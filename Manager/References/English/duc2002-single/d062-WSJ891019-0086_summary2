Although insurers will pay out billions of dollars for damage from this week's California  earthquake, investors predict that the psychological impact of the catastrophe will  produce higher insurance rates and a long-term gain for insurance companies.
Losses  by insurers this year will probably include $2 billion to $4 billion from the quake added to  $4 billion from Hurricane Hugo.
But it is likely that as insurers increase the amount of  reinsurance they buy, reinsurance prices will rise followed by an increase in basic  insurance rates.
Confidence in this scenario of market forces has produced strong  gains in insurance company stocks.
