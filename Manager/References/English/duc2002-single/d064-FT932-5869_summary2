In the midst of tough economic times, McDonald's opened its second restaurant in  Moscow as part of a 12 story office block.
As the value of the ruble plunges, Russian  officials had reason to celebrate McDonald's hamburgers.
Although Russian authorities  have been pleased with McDonald's, citing the fact that most of their supplies come from  Russia, the plunging ruble as well as high inflation and changing tax laws have proven  difficult for McDonald's.
McDonald's officials admitted that they do not know when  they will recoup their original 50M investment.
McDonald's hopes to generate hard  currency by renting out offices to western companies to augment the rubles made from  selling hamburgers.
