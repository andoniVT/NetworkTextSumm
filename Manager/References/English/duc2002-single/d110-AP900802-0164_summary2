Iraq says it invaded Kuwait in response to a request from a Kuwaiti revolutionary  organization.
The diplomatic community is not convinced by the statements issued in the  name of the Provisional Free Kuwait Government.
The United States and the Soviet  Union called for Iraq to withdraw and imposed sanctions.
Iraq has been feuding with Kuwait over a border dispute, and over Kuwait's alleged  violation of its OPEC-ordained oil production quota.
Iraq also alleges that Kuwait was  working in concert with Zionist and colonial powers in plotting against Iraq.
That charge  was made when tensions began to rise in mid-July.
