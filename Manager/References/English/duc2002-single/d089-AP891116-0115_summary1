Recovery efforts continue in Huntsville, Alabama, where a tornado carved a swath of  destruction, killing 17, injuring 463 and leaving 1,000 homeless.
This tornado was one in  a series that struck in at least seven Midwestern and Southern states.
The storm system is  now moving through the Mid-Atlantic states toward New England.
The tornado struck  Huntsville with virtually no warning as the evening rush hour approached.
Although an  elementary school was hit, most of the dead were in apartments, stores, or cars.
Downed  power lines and blocked roads continue to afflict the area.
The nearby Redstone Arsenal  and NASA's Marshall facility were not damaged.
