An experiment with more than 1700 high blood pressure patients showed that a blood and  urine test can pinpoint those patients most likely to have a heart attack.
The tests, which  measure the activity of a blood protein called renin, may also suggest a new risk factor  for heart attacks.
The study was conducted on people found to have mild to moderately  high blood pressure.
Only 12% of these people had high renin "profiles".
But 7 heart  attacks in this small group constituted the highest incidents of heart attacks.
The study  has implications for drug makers as well as patients.
