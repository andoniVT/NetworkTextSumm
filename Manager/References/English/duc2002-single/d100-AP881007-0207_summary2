Cassettes and film footage collected by Yoko Ono constituted the main elements of the movie Imagine: John Lennon.
The items Ono provided were edited to make the late John Lennon the narrator of the much acclaimed film.
Despite her intimacy with the material, Ono found it painful to watch the film.
The movie captures the music and times in which Lennon lived but doesn't delve deeply into the Beatles' drug use and abusive tempers.
Ono says that there is still enough footage for another movie.
Also, Lennon had several unpublished songs, never studio recorded, which might become a record or possibly a musical.
