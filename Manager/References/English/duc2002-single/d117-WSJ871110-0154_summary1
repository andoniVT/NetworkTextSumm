Penelope Lively won the 1987 Booker Prize.
She won for "Moon Tigers", a dying  woman's recollection of and her work as a WW II correspondent and her affair with a  young officer.
The Booker is awarded to the author of the best work of fiction published  in Great Britain during the preceding 12 months.
In late September the judges announce a short-list of six contenders chosen from the  publishers' submissions.
The competition is very popular and elicits heavy betting.
Odds  on Lively were seven-to-one.
The Booker was first awarded in 1969.
The idea was to  devise a British equivalent to the French Prix Goncourt.
