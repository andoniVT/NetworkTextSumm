East Germany's ousted Secret Police Chief Erich Mielke, when he faced former Communist  leader Erich Honecker, called him a traitor and threatened to break his neck.
Honecker was jailed  in January but was released after one day for health reasons.
Mielke, one of Honecker's closest aides, headed the dreaded secret police know as Stasi.
One  prison warden said that many of the guards had worked for Mielke's Stasi and might interpret his  threat as an order to kill Honecker, who will be moved to the same jail if his health improves.
He  is in a hospital and suffering from kidney cancer.
