Russia and Georgia deployed peacekeeping troops to stop ethnic fighting in the disputed region of South Ossetia, which is part of Georgia, in the first peacekeeping operation since the collapse of the Soviet Union.
The disintegration of the Soviet Union has prompted waves of bloodletting in ethnic flashpoints from Romania to the Afghan border.
Russia and Georgia were cautiously optimistic that Ossetia could be the first region of the former Soviet Union where armed conflict could be resolved with the help of "political measures and actions".
The peacekeepers' mission is to form a physical barrier between the two sides, opening the way for future talks.
