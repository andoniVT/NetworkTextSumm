Leonard Bernstein returned to Carnegie Hall with the New York Philharmonic on  Monday, exactly 45 years after his triumphant conducting debut.
He first conducted here  as an emergency fill-in with no rehearsal.
That concert was nationally broadcast and  catapulted Bernstein to fame at age 25.
The shimmering performance, the 1,215th time  he conducted this orchestra, consisted of three Bernstein compositions--"Chichester  Psalms", a serenade, and a symphony.
Performers from his first concert attended on  Monday night, including a violinist who played on both occasions.
Bernstein had  celebrated his 70th birthday this summer at Tanglewood and asked on Monday, "Will this  birthday never end?"
