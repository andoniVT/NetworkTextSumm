Hurricane Gilbert has weakened today to a tropical storm.
The hurricane killed at least  109 people and left more than 800,000 homeless as it barreled through the Caribbean and  Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula.
Tropical storm Gilbert is now 50 miles southeast of  Monterrey, Mexico and continuing to weaken, although a flash flood danger remains.
Residents of the Gulf Coast are relieved, but Gilbert did create a spate of tornadoes in  southern Texas on Friday and Saturday.
Heavy rains are expected in the Rio Grande  valley and later up the Mississippi valley.
Gilbert was responsible for billions of dollars  of damage during its week-long rampage.
