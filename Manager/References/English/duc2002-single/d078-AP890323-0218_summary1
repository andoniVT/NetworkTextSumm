Oscar selection is being scrutinized as studios mount major promotional campaigns to  influence the 4600 voting members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences  voters.

(Over 70  percent of the revenues for 1986's best picture came after the film was nominated.)
Amidst the flood of advertisements and enticements, some Academy members  acknowledge committee voting.
Dan Lyle, who oversees the Oscar balloting for the  accounting firm Price, Waterhouse Inc. said that there is no guarantee that Academy  members have actually filled out their own ballots.
