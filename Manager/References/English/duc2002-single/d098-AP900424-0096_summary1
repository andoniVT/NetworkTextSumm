The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) has arrived  seven years late where it belongs:  aboard the shuttle Discovery orbiting 380 miles above Earth.
It was supposed to be  launched in 1983, but technical problems and the Challenger accident delayed its  deployment.
The telescope has two mirrors, two cameras, two spectrometers, a  photometer, and a fine pointing system providing precise measurement of distances.
On Wednesday a Discovery astronaut will operate the shuttle's mechanical arm to lift  the 12-ton HST out of the cargo bay and drop it overboard to orbit on its own.
Scientists  have hailed the HST as the greatest advance in astronomy since Galileo.
