The Los Angeles marathon has a marketing orientation rather than that of a first class  athletic event.
In only 5 years, it has become the best marketed, slickest, most modern  and sponsor-driven of the world's major marathons.
The lineup of commercial support is  impressive.
Mercedes-Benz, along with other sponsors, provides the race with the bulk  of its operating budget.
The marketing approach makes the race lucrative, but it does not  give it prestige or attract the world's best runners.
Organizers of the marathon expect to  increase this year's total purse of $202,520 by $100,000 next year.
