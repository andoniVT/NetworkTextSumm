Iraq's powerful army quickly claimed victory today in its invasion of Kuwait.
The Kuwaiti  Emir fled to Saudi Arabia.
All of Kuwait is occupied.
Kuwait's U.S. ambassador  appealed for U.S. military intervention.
Iraq's invasion followed its accusation that  Kuwait stole oil from a disputed border area and exceeded OPEC production quotas.
100,000 battle-tested Iraqi tank-led troops had massed on the border in recent days  facing Kuwait's 20,300-strong armed forces.
The Iraqi government claimed it invaded at  the request of revolutionaries who had staged a coup and established "the provisional  government of free Kuwait."
Knowledgeable diplomats labeled the coup report as a  farce.
