Invading Iraqis are trying to appear as Kuwaitis according to charges from the Kuwaiti  ambassador to the United States, Sheik Saud al Nasir al Sabah.
He claims to have  information that the Kuwaitis are being allowed to leave to be replaced by Iraqis, who are  commandeering their homes and even their clothes.
He accused Iraq of trucking people in  and issuing them new identity cards.
Kuwaiti officials who refuse to cooperated are being  executed or bused to Baghdad for further interrogations.
Refugees report that almost all  government buildings and palaces have been destroyed, with only the water systems and  oil equipment spared.
