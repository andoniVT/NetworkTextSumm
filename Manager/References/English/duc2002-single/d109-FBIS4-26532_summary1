After inspecting Zhuzhou and Xiangtan flood areas, Comrade Wen Jiabao (CPC Central  Committee Secretariat member) commended the work in the two cities and issued  important instructions.
Under the leadership of the provincial party committee and  government, the cadres and people had rescued a number of industrial and mining  enterprises.
After the water recedes, they should concentrate on aiding the victims,  resuming production and reconstructing homes.
He noted that the peak flood season has  not arrived, and the people cannot relax.
He also stressed that the current flooding has  revealed problems in the construction of water conservancy facilities and urban flood  control.
