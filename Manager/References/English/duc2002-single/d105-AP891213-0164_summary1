The Soviet government has decided to give ethnic Germans and Crimean Tatars who were expelled from their homelands by Stalin their own autonomous region.
Since others now occupy their lands and houses, the resettlement could take up to 10 years.
Trouble has already broken out between ethnic Germans and Russians along the Volga River.
There are some 500,000 Crimean Tatars and 2 million ethnic Germans in the Soviet Union.
A wave of 100,00 Germans emigrated to West Germany, but many would stay if they could be assured of their own republic.
Stalin believed that the Tatars and Germans could not be trusted in strategic areas.
