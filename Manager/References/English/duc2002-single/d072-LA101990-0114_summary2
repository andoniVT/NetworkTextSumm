Sony Classical and Deutsche Grammophon, which control most of Leonard Bernstein's  recordings, and BMG Classics/RCA Red Seal will accelerate re-releases of Bernstein  recordings.
Bernstein, one of the most documented conductors ever, died Sunday.
Deutsche Grammophon will release the only new recordings (Tchaikovsky's Fifth with  the New York Philharmonic, two Mozart symphonies and the clarinet concerto with the  Vienna Philharmonic and Schubert's Symphonies Nos.
5 and 8 with the Concertgebouw  Orchestra of Amsterdam) next month.
The Bernstein catalogue includes over 200  recordings, but the home-video market is limited to three 1971 "Bernstein on Beethoven"  programs and three movies whose scores he composed.
