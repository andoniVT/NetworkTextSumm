Iraq's deputy UN representative says Iraq has no objective concerning its invasion of  Kuwait and wishes only cordial relations with it.
The Kuwaitis will determine their own  future and Iraqi forces will withdraw as soon as order has been restored.
Kuwait's UN  ambassador says Iraq's pretext for invading an independent, sovereign state is false and  flimsy.
If not deterred by the UN in a decisive manner, all international relations will be  threatened.
No country will be safe.
President Bush says, "We remain committed to take  whatever actions are necessary to defend our longstanding, vital interests in the [Persian]  Gulf."
