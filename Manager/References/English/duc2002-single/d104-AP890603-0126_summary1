By dawn on Sunday tanks and riflemen controlled Tiananmen Square.
Troops were  deployed on the Monument to Revolutionary Heroes in the square's center, and more at  important nearby intersections.
Most of the killed late Saturday and early Sunday fell in  the streets leading to the square where crowds tried to prevent troops from reaching the  square.
Once the troops controlled the square and the firing diminished, loudspeakers blared  government and student announcements.
At 4 A.M. lampposts in the square darkened.
After the lights came back on students began filing our of the square.
