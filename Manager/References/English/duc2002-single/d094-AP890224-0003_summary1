To the rest of the world, he was known as Emperor Hirohito, but in Japan his name was  rarely used.
Japanese found the foreign practice of using his given name impolite and  referred to him simply as His majesty, the Emperor.
Japanese histories will record him as  Emperor Showa, the name he chose when he became emperor in 1926.
His son, Akihito  succeeded Emperor Hirohito and has chosen the name Heisei.
Japan numbers the years  according to the emperor's tenure on the thrown.
Thus the first year of Hirohito's reign  was Showa 1.
Until he died, 1989 was Showa 64, now it is Heisei 1.
