The battle for Tiananmen Square was fought primarily  in the streets leading to the  square where scores of people fell trying to prevent troops and armored military  vehicles from moving on the students camped in the square.
The first troops entered  the square about 1 a.m. Sunday followed by a huge convoy of armored vehicles that  surrounded the few thousand students that remained.
A propaganda battle by  loudspeaker ensued.
By 4:30 a.m. the students decided by voice vote to leave the  square to avoid further bloodshed.
As dawn broke rifle-toting troops ruled the vast  expanse occupied the day before by students seeking a freer society.
