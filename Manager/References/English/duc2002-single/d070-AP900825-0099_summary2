Ousted East German leader, Erich Honecker will not stand trial in East Germany as long  as the formerly communist country exists.
Honecker could be prosecuted in a united  Germany, however, for violation of property laws.
Honecker is accused of using 42  million to stock a private housing estate for leaders of the former Communist  government.
Since being ousted in October 1989, he remains confined in a Soviet  hospital outside Berlin in poor health.
He is under investigation for abuse of power,  corruption, harboring terrorists and issuing shoot to kill orders to prevent East Germans  from escaping to West Germany.
