Signs of the devastation wrought by the flash flood that hit the outskirts of Shadyside  Thursday night are everywhere.
Cement blocks are all that remain of some homes; fallen  branches stand where trees used to be; cars are mired in roof-deep mud, and guardrails  and chunks of concrete have been torn from roads.
Five inches of rain fell in 3 hours, churning floodwaters that left at least 11 people dead  and 51 others missing early today.
At least 170 members of the Ohio National Guard were summoned to patrol and help  rebuild the roads, said an Ohio Emergency Management Agency spokesperson.
