This morning New York City's Chinatown responded to events in Beijing.
More than  5,000 people chanting, "Freedom will survive!"
packed a Chinatown park in a memorial  service for students killed by soldiers in Tiananmen Square.
The crowd stood  respectfully and silently during a traditional funeral ceremony and then marched through  the streets in a funeral procession waving banners honoring "the martyrs of Tiananmen  Square."
As they headed up Mulberry Street, a major street in Chinatown, they walked  beneath a 30-foot black banner.
Demonstrators planned another rally later in the day  outside the United Nations.
