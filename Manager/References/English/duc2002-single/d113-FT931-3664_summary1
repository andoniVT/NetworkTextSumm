13 explosions rocked Bombay on Friday leaving at least 255 people dead and over  1,200 injured.
Unlike the riots that racked the city last December, Friday's attack was  clearly high-technology terrorism carried out with Semtex plastic explosives, high-grade  timers, efficient organization and money.
India's prime minister described the blasts as  an attack on India's economy and said the search for the perpetrators "may not stop  within the country," but stopped short of mentioning Pakistan.
The Bombay Stock  Exchange plans to resume trading today and  the people of Bombay have refused to be  goaded into violent protest by the bombers.
