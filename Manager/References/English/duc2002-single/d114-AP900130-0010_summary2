An intelligence officer in Srinagar in Kashmir told his men to shoot any of the die-hard terrorists they spot as their jeep patrols the streets of this city of one million people.
The governor of Jammu-Kashmir said that "a handful of terrorists" are creating a law and order problem, which led to a government crackdown.
The separatists groups are not united, which gives the government an advantage.
At least 72 people have been killed in the past week.
At the end of British colonial rule in 1947, Kashmir opted to join India.
Pakistan took the western part of Kashmir and India the eastern.
