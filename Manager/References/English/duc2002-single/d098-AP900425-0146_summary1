Discovery's astronauts sent the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) floating free from the  shuttle today and it began orbiting Earth every 97.3 minutes at an altitude of 380 miles.
Ground controllers had difficulty unfurling two 39-foot solar panels which provide the  power to recharge the telescope's batteries but succeeded on a third try.
Earlier this  morning the Discovery commander maneuvered the shuttle into its deployment position  to put the HST's solar arrays in the proper position to quickly start collecting energy.
The HST is 43 feet long, weighs 24,250 pounds and is about the size of a railroad tank  car.
