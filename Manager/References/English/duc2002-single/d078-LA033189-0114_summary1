The Walt Disney Co. filed a suit Thursday against the Academy of Motion Picture Arts  and Sciences, charging copyright infringement of its Snow White character.
Disney  claims it took action after the academy failed to publicly apologize for the use of the  character.
Bruce Davis, the academy's executive administrator, declined comment.
Eileen Bowman portrayed Snow White in a 10-minute song and dance routine that  opened Wednesday night's awards ceremony.
Steve Silver created the Snow White character portrayed Wednesday.
Though he has  used it for 15 years in a musical, Disney has never sued him over the character in that  production.
