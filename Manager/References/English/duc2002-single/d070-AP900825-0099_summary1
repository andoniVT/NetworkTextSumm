A West German newspaper reported that ousted East German leader Erich Honecker will not  stand trial in East Germany as long as the formerly Communist country exists, although he could  be prosecuted in a united Germany for violation of property laws.
Honecker allegedly used $42 million for stocking a private housing estate for Communist  government leaders.
However, the investigation is not far enough along to determine whether  charges would be filed against Honecker before the East German-West German merger.
He is  under investigation for abuse of power, corruption, harboring terrorists, and issuing shoot-to-kill  orders against East Germans escaping to West Germany.
