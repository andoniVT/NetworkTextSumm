Iraq's President Saddam Hussein seemed determined to solve his financial problems and  fulfill territorial ambitions by conquering Kuwait.
He accused Kuwait of costing Iraq  billions in lost oil revenue by exceeding OPEC assigned quotas and by "stealing" oil  from a disputed field that straddles their borders.
Further, he was incensed that Kuwait  was demanding repayment of its estimated $15 billion in 1980s wartime loans to Iraq.
It  is believed Saddam would use the Kuwaiti precedent to dominate neighboring countries  on policy issues.
He has long sought to inherit the mantle of the late Egyptian President  Nassar as leader of the Arab world.
