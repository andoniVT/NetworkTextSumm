Port workers in Szczecin, Poland and southwestern coal miners declared sympathy strikes  with miners demanding the legalization of Solidarity according to opposition activists.
A  local prosecutor declared the strike illegal.
In support of 3000 colleagues striking for a  second day at a mine in Jastrzebie, workers at a nearby mine refused to take up their tools  and launched their own strike.
The strikes mark the eighth anniversary of the birth of  Solidarity, which Communist authorities crushed in a 1981 military crackdown.
Miners  are demanding the legalization of Solidarity, pay raises and reinstatement of workers  fired for union activities.
