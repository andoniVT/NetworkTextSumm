In Huntsville, Ala., a tornado slammed into a shopping district, a residential area and a  school Wednesday, killing at least 14 people, injuring nearly 300 and trapping many  others in their cars and homes.
It touched down between 4 and 4:30 p.m., when city  streets were filled with rush-hour traffic.
One witness said that it started picking up cars  and strewing them around... heavy overhead power lines started snapping just like a  whip.
Telephone communication and electricity were disrupted.
Only one radio station  remained broadcasting.
Rescuers are digging in the rubble.
State police were called from  around the state to help.
