The Kuwaiti Embassy announced on Wednesday that Iraqi troops had launched an  offensive against Kuwait.
Earlier, Iraq had moved about 100,000 troops to its Kuwaiti  border after claiming that Kuwait's production of oil beyond quotas of the OPEC cartel  had depressed the world price, thus diminishing Iraq's revenue, and that Kuwait had been  stealing oil from a field that straddles the border.
On Tuesday, John Kelly, a State  Department spokesman, told a House subcommittee that the United States has no treaty  obligations mandating military support for Kuwait; however, we do believe strongly in  respect for territories of all states in the region.
