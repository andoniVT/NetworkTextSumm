An earthquake that measured 6.5 on the Richter scale devastated parts of Nepal and India  earlier this week, killing more than 980 people.
In Bhaktapur, Nepal, mourners called for  revenge after political rivals beat a former legislator to death while he was distributing  relief supplies to earthquake victims.
Karna Hyanju, once a Communist Party  sympathizer, was beaten and then dragged through the streets for nearly two hours before  police intervened.
He was accosted by a group of men who accused him of giving relief  supplies only to his own supporters.
Several people have been arrested in the killing,  including the mayor.
