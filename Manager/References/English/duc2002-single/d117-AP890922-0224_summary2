Six novels have been nominated for the Booker Prize, Britain's most prestigious fiction award.
Bookmakers say the favorite is Japanese author Kazuo Ishiguro's "The Remains of the Day"  about a butler's travels through Britain's West Country.
An odds maker gave it 7 to 4 odds.
More interest in the award than ever before is expected because of last year's controversy over  Salmon Rushdie's "Satanic Verses".
Rushdie lost out last year to Australian author Peter Carey  for his "Oscar and Lucinda".
Rushdie, a British citizen, has been hiding since February 14 when  the Iranian leader Khomeini ordered him killed for blaspheming Islam in "Satanic Verses".
