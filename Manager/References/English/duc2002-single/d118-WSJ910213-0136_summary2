The nomination of John Tower as Secretary of Defense failed in the Senate as Tower fell victim  to charges of moral and ethical misbehavior.
Tower insisted that Senator Nunn used FBI inquiries  to discredit him and to strike at the president of the United States.
Tower was qualified for the  job, having himself served as chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee.
Tower's  intelligence and patriotism were never in question and it came as a surprise to him that he had  made many enemies in Washington.
Allegations from conservative groups as well as Tower's  second wife fed the rumors surrounding him.
