On Easter Sunday, three Cabinet ministers supported John Major in the wake of  speculation that he could be forced out this autumn.
Both Secretary of State for Education  John Patten and Michael Howard, the Home Secretary, dismissed talk of a leadership  contest before the next general election.
Lord Wakeham, Leader of the House of Lords,  called on Torries to be loyal to Mr. Major.
One poll shows that Michael Heseltine is the favorite to replace Mr. Major if he is forced  out, but that Michael Portillo will vigorously campaign to secure Eurosceptic policies  from the eventual winner.
