A powerful storm system brought heavy thunderstorms, tornados, and strong winds to the  Northeast on Thursday.
Tornados were reported in New Jersey, Delaware, Virginia, and  New York.
Strong thunderstorms hit in a broad area.
Seven children were killed and 18  injured when a wall collapsed near Newburgh, New York.
A large variation in  temperatures has made this front, the same one that hit the South and the Ohio valley  yesterday, extremely strong.
A tornado watch remains for northeast New York state and  much of Vermont and New Hampshire.
Snow is following the front and cold weather is  expected in the Southeast.
