The Los Angeles marathon is a commercial spectacle.
It has been designed to make  money for the closely held company that controls it as well as for the city.
More than  18,000 runners are expected this year and the event is expected to gross about 5 million  in cash and services to break even.
The event lacks some of the superstars who race in  Boston, New York and London.
Big-name runners want to be paid a lot and marathon  commissioners refuse to spend extraordinary amounts of money on any single runner.
The event may surpass New York in numbers of participants next year.
