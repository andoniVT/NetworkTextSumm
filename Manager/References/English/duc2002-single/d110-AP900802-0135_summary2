Iraq's powerful army, led by the Republican Guard, invaded Kuwait today and quickly  overran the small oil-rich country.
Kuwait's armed forces number only 20,300.
Iraq  claimed the invasion was launched at the request of Kuwaiti revolutionaries.
Kuwait  immediately appealed for United States help.
There were wide-ranging ramifications.
Oil prices shot up three dollars per barrel.
The  United States froze Iraqi assets, and blocked oil imports.
The Soviet Union, Iraq's main  arms supplier, halted weapons sales.
The United Nations Security Council voted 14-0 to  denounce the invasion and demanded immediate withdrawal of Iraqi forces.
