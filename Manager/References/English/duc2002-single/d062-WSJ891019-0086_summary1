Insurers may have to pay billions of dollars for this weekend's California earthquake.
The  damage goes far beyond that of Hurricane Hugo along the Carolinas last month.
But investors  hope the financial and psychological impact of the earthquake will stem the price-cutting wars  between insurers the past two years.
Insurers are rushing into the area to process claims.
About 25% of the policyholders have  earthquake insurance.
The claims are not expected to cause significant financial problems for  the insurers as a whole.
They are likely to increase the amount of reinsurance they buy, which  will translate into an overall price rise.
