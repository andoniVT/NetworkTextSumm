Iraq's army invaded tiny oil-rich Kuwait today and with a force of 100,000 quickly  overcame the smaller country's 20,300-strong armed forces.
A Kuwaiti government  official announced that all of Kuwait was occupied.
There were immediate  repercussions.
President Bush froze Iraqi assets in the U.S. and blocked most Iraqi  imports including oil.
The Soviet Union halted weapon sales to Iraq.
On Friday Soviet  Foreign Minister Shevardnadze and U.S. Secretary of State Baker plan a joint  statement in Moscow on the invasion, apparently lining up the two super powers on the  same side for a change.
The U.N. Security Council voted 14-0 denouncing the invasion  and demanding an Iraqi withdrawal.
