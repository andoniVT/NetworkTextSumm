The families of Peace Corps volunteers Peter Giaquinta and Bettyjean Bouffard learned  Thursday that they were safe.
Both Peter and Bettyjean live in area of Nepal hardest hit  by the earthquake that killed over 750 in that country and India.
Peace Corps spokesman Jim Flanigan said all but three of the 157 volunteers in Nepal are  safe.
The three still unaccounted for, whose names were not released, are from Michigan,  Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.
Washed out roads, he explained, have compounded the  difficulty of reaching volunteers in remote areas.
There are no Peace Corps workers in  India.
