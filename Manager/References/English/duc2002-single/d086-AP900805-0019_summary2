The new Iraqi-installed government of Kuwait claimed that Iraqi troops began a pullout  from Kuwait Sunday, but the United States doesn't believe it.
The new government is  reportedly led by Col. Ala Hussein Ali who holds the four primary ministries.
Kuwait's  embassy in Jordan identifies Ali as Saddam's son-in-law.
Meanwhile the tens of  thousands of Iraqi troops massed near Kuwait's border with Saudi Arabia gave no sign  of movement and as U.S., French and British warships steamed toward the Persian  Gulf, President Bush said Friday that an Iraqi move against Saudi Arabia would be  attacking U.S. "vital interests".
He stated Saturday that use of force remains an option.
