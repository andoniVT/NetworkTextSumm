The Broadway theatrical community said goodbye Thursday to Leonard Bernstein at the  Majestic Theater.
The public started lining up at 7 a.m. to join invited friends, relatives  and theatrical personalities.
Arthur Laurents, the librettist for "West Side Story", was  host.
Other collaborators, original cast members, and old friends, several coming from  California, spoke and performed.
His son, Alexander, delivered an affectionate talk,  while Michael Wager, a very close friend at the end, spoke movingly about Bernstein's  final illness.
The program closed with Marilyn Horne singing "Somewhere", the  emotional anthem from "West Side Story."
A sustained standing ovation ended the  evening.
