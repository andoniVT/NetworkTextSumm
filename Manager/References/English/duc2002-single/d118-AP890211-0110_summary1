Defense Secretary-designate John Tower's testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee that his work for a British firm did not involve military matters contradicts a sworn statement he made earlier in a divorce deposition.
In that earlier deposition, Tower said that he had advised British Aerospace on how to sell planes and missile systems to the Pentagon.
The New York Post reported that the FBI was lax in investigating incidents involving Tower, particularly one in a Dallas hotel wherein he was in "no condition to free himself" from an armchair fire.
Also brought into question were early morning accidents in which Tower wrecked his car.
