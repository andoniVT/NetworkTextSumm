Sir Robert Clark , Chairman of Mirror Group Newspapers, in a statement issued  released yesterday lists a number of unusual payments for MGN.
The transactions,   involved Mr. Michael Stoney, a senior executive in a number of Maxwell companies, as  well as Kevin and Ian Maxwell, two sons of the late Robert Maxwell.
Although Sir Robert  stresses that the transactions may have been legitimate, he says legal actions may be  taken against a number of organizations, Including Goldman Sachs, the U.S. investment  bank.
At issue is whether the bank was aware than more than Pounds 40m in transfers  from MGN were effected for improper purposes.
