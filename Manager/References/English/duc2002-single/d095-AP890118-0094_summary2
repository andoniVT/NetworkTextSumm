A 26-year-old drifter with a long criminal record opened fire with an assault rifle at  Cleveland Elementary School in Stockton, California Tuesday, killing five children and  wounding 30 others before killing himself.
Children and officials there will receive cards  and encouragement from their counterparts at Oakland Elementary School in Greenwood,  South Carolina, where a similar thing happened last September 26th.
In Greenwood, a  man with a history of mental problems opened fire with a handgun and killed two  children and wounded nine.
Physical education teacher Kat Finkbeiner, whose jaw was  shattered in the shooting, helped subdue 19-year-old gunman Jamie Wilson.
The  California tragedy brought Greenwood painful memories.
