Mikhail Gorbachev urged all sides to take their time deciding the fate of Erich Honecker as the  fugitive former East German leader spent a seventh day of refuge inside the Chilean Embassy in  Moscow.
Germany wants to try him for ordering the shooting of people who attempted to flee to  the West during his regime.
There is speculation, however, that German politicians have little  real interest in trying a man who may possess embarrassing secrets.
Gorbachev, Honecker's protector until the Soviet leader's political fortunes declined, has ordered  Honecker to leave the country.
North Korea apparently has offered to accept Honecker.
