Gale Gordon, a sidekick of Lucille Ball from radio days who appeared with her in three  television series recalled how the comedian never thought of herself as particularly  funny.
Lucille Ball died in April 1989 at the age of 77.
Gordon first met Miss Ball in  1947 in the radio program "My Favorite Husband", which later became the television  show "I Love Lucy".
They starred together in "The Lucy Show" which ran from 1962- 68, in "Here's Lucy" from 1969-1975 and briefly in 1986 in "Life with Lucy".
"The  world will miss her greatly," Gordon said.
