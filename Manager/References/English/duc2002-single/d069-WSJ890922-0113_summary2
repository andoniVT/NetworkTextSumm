Democratic reforms elsewhere in the Eastern Bloc have magnified the emerging  opposition to uncompromising Communist rule in East Germany.
The mass emigration  of thousands of disaffected East Germans has impelled  West Germany's Parliamentary  Speaker to place the subject of reunification on his committee's agenda.
Recent polls  show that between 85% and 90% of all West Germans favor a reunified Germany, but  officials there are circumspect of the concerns of Washington and Moscow.
However,  the U.S.
Ambassador to Bonn predicted that reunion could occur relatively soon.
Because East Germany is the Soviet's most important Warsaw Pact satellite, Moscow  may not be so agreeable.
