The battleship Iowa steamed home from Puerto Rico Friday under its own power,  following an explosion on board that killed 47.
Investigators interviewed crewmen and  reviewed a videotape of the explosion made by an officer to record the firing of the big  guns.
Reportedly, deaths in the gun turret's upper chamber resulted from the explosion  and fire while those in lower levels were from suffocation when the blast sucked all the  oxygen out of the spaces.
After extinguishing the fire, crew removed shells and powder  from two other gun barrels in the turret.
Senate Armed Services Committee will hold  hearings on the explosion.
