Checkpoint Charlie, the allied border crossing by the Berlin Wall, will be hauled away  Friday.
A huge crane hangs over the guardhouse where a sign in English, German,  Russian, and French says, "You are now leaving the American sector."
U.S. Secretary  of State Baker, Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze and the foreign ministers from  France, Britain, and the two Germanys will preside over a ceremonial removal of the  checkpoint Friday.
The statesmen were in East Berlin to discuss German unification.
The U.S. decided two weeks ago, with huge sections of the wall being ripped down  daily, that it was a good time to remove the landmark.
