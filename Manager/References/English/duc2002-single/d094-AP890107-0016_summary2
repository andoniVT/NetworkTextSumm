Emperor Hirohito, 87, will be remembered for his first effective and the most courageous  decision during his 62-year reign: Japan must surrender and end the Pacific conflict in  WW II.
He is generally portrayed as having played no significant role in Japan's war  efforts.
In the first 20 years of his reign, Hirohito was worshipped as a divinity.
On January 1,  1945 he publicly renounced his divinity, enabling him to remain as the symbolic head of  Japan and assuring that he would not face charges as a war criminal.
In post-WW II  Japan, he was often viewed as a kind uncle.
