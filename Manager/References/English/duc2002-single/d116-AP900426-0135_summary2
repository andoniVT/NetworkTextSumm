On Wednesday, Discovery's robot arm grasped the $1.5 billion, 12-ton Hubble Space Telescope, NASA's most expensive unmanned spacecraft, and hoisted  it into space.
After  problems in unfurling a solar panel array were overcome, Discovery  backed away and parked in orbit 46 miles behind.
For six hours, ground controllers tried  to make contact with Hubble's two high-gain antennas, finally doing so by nearly  doubling the antenna's beam width, to 10.8 degrees.
The problem was incorrect pointing  of either Hubble or the TDRS, an orbiting communications satellite.
Today the telescope  will be tested for  maneuverability before the aperture door is opened Friday to expose  the mirror to starlight.
