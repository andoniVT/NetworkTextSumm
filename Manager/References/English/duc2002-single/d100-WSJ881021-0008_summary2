A review of Albert Goldman's The Lives of John Lennon  says that the author has taken the path of many celebrity biographers who select a subject of respectable reputation and proceed to blacken it.
The review by Andrew Ferguson appeared in the Wall Street Journal.
The late Beatle had often recounted his own squalid history of drug use and sexual promiscuity.
After he married Yoko Ono, Lennon believed his worst days were behind him.
Ferguson says the book is poorly written, awkwardly organized, and emphasizes minor events while skipping over major ones.
Its shows no other purpose than to make a man look bad.
