In a single year, four ferry accidents left 320 people dead and at least 8 missing.
Two of  the ferries had exceeded their capacity.
One ferry taking schoolchildren on a visit to a  hydroelectric power station sank off Hainan Island.
The ferry capsized before it had gone  200 yards.
The others occurred in the Guangxi region near Vietnam, on the Min River in  Sichuan province and on the Yangtze River.
The ministry responsible for inland water  navigation announced that it had begun an investigation into the safety of china's river  vessels to determine if standards should be tightened.
