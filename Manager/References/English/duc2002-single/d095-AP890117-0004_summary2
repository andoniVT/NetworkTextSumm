On Tuesday, within hours after a gunman opened fire at Cleveland Elementary School in  Stockton, CA, killing five children and himself and wounding 30 others, 25 translators  who spoke Southeast Asian languages rushed to the school and hospitals to assist non- English-speaking parents.
One hospital called for help because its staff with language  skills was overloaded.
Translators were located and sent by the Charterhouse Center  refugee program, which is funded by the Episcopal Church and private donations.
Southeast Asians have been drawn recently by Stockton's farming and fishing.
Sixty  percent of the school's students are from Cambodia, Laos or Thailand.
The five children  killed were all Asian.
