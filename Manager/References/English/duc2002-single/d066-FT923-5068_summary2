Sam Walton died in April 1992.
Shortly before his death he wrote about his life in a book  entitled, "Made in America: My Story".
It is the story of a happily married and well-liked  man who lived frugally in an obscure corner of Arkansas.
Readers may find the book boring and dreary.
It is full of common sense, and charming  and humorous anecdotes.
It does not directly address his company's non-union policies,  and the impact of his 40 billion dollar giant on the mom-and-pop stores in the small  towns where he located his stores.
