The Wal-Mart Stores, Inc, will open a Visitors Center on Wednesday here in Bentonville  on the downtown square where Sam Walton opened for business on 9 May 1950.
That  store was a Ben Franklin franchise.
It was not until 1962 that the first Wal-Mart was  opened.
The Center chronicles the growth of Wal-Mart.
Today it has 1500 stores, 272,000  employees and listed sales of 25.8 billion dollars.
Displays include a replica of Walton's  original office, and a hula skirt that he wore for his "dance on Wall Street" after the  company surpassed the profit goal for 1984.
