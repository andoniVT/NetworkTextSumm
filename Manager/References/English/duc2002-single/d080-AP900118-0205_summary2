The McMartin Pre-School molestation case began in August 1983 when Judy Johnson  accused Raymond Buckey of molesting her son.
By March 1984, a public outcry had  been created and seven people were arrested for abusing 18 children over 10 years.
In  January 1986, the preliminary hearing, after 18 months and $4 million, brought 135  counts against the seven.
Charges later were dismissed against all but Buckey and his  mother.
Jury selection began in April 1987 and the actual trial ran from July until  November 1989.
On January 18, 1990 they were acquitted on 52 counts, with a mistrial  declared on 13 counts.
