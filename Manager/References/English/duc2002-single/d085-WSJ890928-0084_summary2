Damage from Hurricane Hugo which tore through the Caribbean last week will  reduce third-quarter earnings for several insurers.
American International Group  expects a reduction in pretax earnings of $35-45 million.
St. Paul Cos. said the  pretax cost shouldn't exceed $50 million and for Cigna Corp. a reduction of 35- 40% in per share earnings on an after-tax basis is predicted.
State Farm's State  Fire and Casualty Co. estimates payouts of over $500 million, three times the  previous record of $165 million set by Hurricane Alicia in 1983.
Most of these  estimates take into account recoveries from the companies' reinsurance  contracts.
