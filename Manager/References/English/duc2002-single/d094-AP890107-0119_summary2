Though many world leaders mourned the death of Emperor Hirohito on Saturday, painful  WW II memories still generated criticism of the Japanese monarch.
South Korea sent condolences, but a government party statement added, "We reserve  further comment, considering the unhappy past."
Taiwan will be represented at the funeral, but a Taiwanese newspaper said, "While  Hirohito apologized to the United States and Europe, he did not direct a single word to  China to show his sorrow."
The Netherlands sent sympathy without mentioning the name "Hirohito" in its message.
Over 20,000 people died under Japan's wartime occupation of the former Dutch East  Indies.
