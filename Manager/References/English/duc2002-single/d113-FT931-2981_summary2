Terror struck India again last night when an explosion destroyed two blocks of  apartments in the center of Calcutta.
At least 45 were killed and scores injured.
Identity  of the bombers is unknown but the explosion is just five days after bombs struck  Bombay.
A militant Sikh group has claimed responsibility for the Bombay blasts but  police remain unconvinced, saying a foreign group was involved.
Many fear these bomb  attacks are designed to renew communal strife and undermine government efforts to  attract foreign investment and tourism.
India is still recovering from violence that  followed the destruction of a mosque in northern India.
