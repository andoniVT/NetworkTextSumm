There were several shining moments for US Olympians in the 1988 Summer Games.
Diver Greg Louganis won a second pair of gold medals after a springboard accident, track star Florence Griffith Joyner won three golds and a silver medal, and her sister-in-law, Jackie Joiner-Kersee won two golds.
Canadian Ben Johnson had rocketed to a world record performance over US sprinter Carl Lewis in the 100 meter but was stripped of the gold medal when he tested positive for anabolic steroid use.
The Games also saw increasing anti-American sentiment by the host Koreans because of perceived rudeness of the US team and NBC coverage of events.
