A biography of former Beatle John Lennon by Albert Goldman, discloses a sometime  unflattering portrait of both Lennon and his second wife Yoko Ono.
Goldman claims that  Lennon spent much of a three-year span sleeping or smoking marijuana.
Between 1976  and 1979 the author says Lennon was a recluse.
Lennon also spent most of his adult life  as an anorexic.
The biography also details Yoko Ono's $5,000-a-week heroin habit in  1979.
Goldman spent more than six years researching the book, interviewing 1200  friends, relatives and associates of Lennon, who was murdered in New York in 1980.
