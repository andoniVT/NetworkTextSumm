During Dan Quayle's campaign, every gaffe he made was news and he refused all  requests from national interview shows.
Now one year after his election, he has appeared  on "Meet the Press".
Quayle was pleased with the seriousness of the questions but said  little in reply.
His goal in the vice-presidency has been to support the President and not  make news.
The selection of Dan Quayle as running mate was Bush's first major decision  of his presidential campaign and was thought by many to be a bad choice.
Bush  emphasized that it wasn't by saying recently that Quayle would be on the ticket in 1992.
