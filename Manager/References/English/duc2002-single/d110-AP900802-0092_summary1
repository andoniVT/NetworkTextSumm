The U.N. Security Council demanded that Iraq unconditionally withdraw its invasion  forces from Kuwait.
Iraq's U.N. representative said they would withdraw when the "free  Kuwaiti interim government' of "revolutionary youth" who toppled the Kuwaiti  government, and to whose aid they came, requested it.
Iraq said this was an internal, not  a U.N. matter.
The Kuwaiti ambassador to the U.N. said this was "a false, flimsy  pretext" and if not deterred in a decisive manner, all international relations will be  threatened.
The U.S. declared that it stands with Kuwait.
Kuwait wants its negotiations  with Iraq mediated by the Arab League.
