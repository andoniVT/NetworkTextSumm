The reactionary elements staging the coup in the Soviet Union miscalculated by thinking the issue was Mikhail Gorbachev.
They apparently believed that by neutralizing him they could take charge.
Freedom and democracy were the real issue.
The failure of the counterrevolution will accelerate the revolution rather than destroying it.
Boris Yeltsin is seen as the man who saved Gorbachev.
He possesses talents that Gorbachev lackes: he is close to the Russian people and is eager to challenge the apparatus of the Communist Party.
Gorbachev had thought he needed the upper echelons of the Party to protect him from those who opposed his reforms.
