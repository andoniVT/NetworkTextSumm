Winnie Mandela, wife of African National Congress leader, Nelson Mandela was  convicted of kidnapping and sentenced to six years in prison.
Her husband has been  working since his release from prison 15 months ago, to end the murderous conflict  between black political factions.
He has loyally defended her innocence, but ANC  radicals may use the conviction to turn members against Mandela's policy of peace and  negotiation and move him aside.
But both de Klerk and Mandela and their followers  have a common interest in creating a new, non-racial South Africa.
The next step is  formal negotiations.
