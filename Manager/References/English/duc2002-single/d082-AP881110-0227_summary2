In New York Thursday, Andrei D. Sakharov, father of the Soviet dissident movement,  received the 1973 Human Rights Award from the International League for Human  Rights.
Sakharov helped found an affiliate group, the Moscow Human Rights Committee,  in 1971.
Reception guests included Elie Wiesel, Elizabeth Holtzman, and Barbara  Walters.
Less than two years ago, the 67-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner was freed by  Gorbachev from internal exile in Gorky, where he was banished in 1980 for opposing  Soviet occupation of Afghanistan.
Sakharov's first US visit began Sunday.
He will visit  relatives, the White House, receive medical treatment, and meet with the International  Foundation for the Survival and Development of Humanity.
