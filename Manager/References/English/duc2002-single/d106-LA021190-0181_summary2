Nelson Mandela has dominated the fight for black rights in South Africa for most of his  life.
At 26, he joined the African National Congress, which soon became the force  behind black protests and civil disobedience against the government policy of apartheid.
In 1960 the ANC was outlawed and in 1964 Mandela was convicted of conspiracy to  overthrow the government and sentenced to life in prison.
Although in prison, he was a  powerful symbol of government oppression of blacks and refused release in 1986 until  the government dismantled apartheid.
On February 11, 1990 he was finally released.
