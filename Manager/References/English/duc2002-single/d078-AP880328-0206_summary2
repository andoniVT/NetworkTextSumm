The annual Academy Awards ceremony has generated a wealth of statistics and trivia in  its 60 years.
Oscar historians chronicle what actors, directors, studios, and films have  received the most Oscars or been nominated most often.
Other factoids concern the  youngest, oldest, or posthumous recipients; family members who have been recipients in  the same picture; actors nominated in multiple categories, performers who have refused  their Oscars, those who have never appeared to collect their award; the number of TV  viewers, the number of countries watching, the speed of reading the rules, and who  decapitated his Oscar while practicing his golf swing.
