World leaders welcomed South Africa's announcement that Nelson Mandela would be released from prison.
Many of the world's nations had cut off commercial contact with South Africa because of its policy of apartheid.
Anti-apartheid foes warned against lessening pressure against South Africa even as they celebrated the announcement.
International support for anti-apartheid victims should continue.
A different line was taken by Britain's Margaret Thatcher who said "it no longer makes sense to discourage new investment in South Africa".
Mandela was hailed for "his indomitable courage".
The Commonwealth Secretary General said that South Africa must guarantee Mandela's safety until change there becomes irreversible.
