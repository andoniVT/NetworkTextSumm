The Hubble Space Telescope's science instruments are on hold, unable to begin  observations.
The Hubble had been on "safe mode" with all motion stopped because of  earlier problems in linking the high-speed dish antennas with a relay satellite.
Ground  controllers then took the telescope out of safe mode and began to run a 12-hour computer  program to monitor its health.
It is now on a "normal control-all mode" where its own  computers and sensors guide it.
Hubble's systems were set at conservative limits for  initial operations and that caused many malfunctions.
With most resolved, the shuttle  Discovery astronauts are preparing to return home.
