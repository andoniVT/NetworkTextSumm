President Mikhail Gorbachev furiously denounced the plotters who briefly overthrew him but  said their failure could be an "enormous opportunity" to further his democratic reforms.
He  detailed his purge of the coup leaders and pledged cooperation with and praised Russian  Republic President Boris Yeltsin and said he did not plan to leave the Communist Party.
While in confinement in Crimea during the ouster, Gorbachev said his captors cut off all  communications and his only source of news was foreign broadcasts.
He refused demands that  he resign and prepared himself and his family for the possibility they would be killed.
