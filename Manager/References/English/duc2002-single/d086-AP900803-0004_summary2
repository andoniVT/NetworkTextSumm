Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's occupation of Kuwait reflects his  need to escape  from economic and social problems arising from the eight-year war with Iran.
Saddam  says he fought the war to protect Sunni Arabs from the fundamentalist Shiite Persian  revolution in Iran and should not be expected to repay war debts to fellow Sunni Arabs.
By focusing on claimed misdeeds of Kuwait he hopes to divert attention from the  economic and social chaos reigning at home while gaining the wealth and territory  represented by Kuwait.
This is the first time that an Arab state has deposed the  government of a fellow Arab League member.
