Chess and Bridge yesterday took over the business assets of Maxwell Macmillan Chess and  Bridge.
The late Robert Maxwell thought of himself as a "strong" chess player.
There may be  doubts about his strength as a player but less about his enthusiasm for the game.
In 1990, he  sponsored a section of the World Chess Championships in New York.
When Pergamon was sold  to Elsevier last year, Maxwell kept the chess and bridge publishing businesses.
Despite of year of difficulties in buying the Maxwell businesses, which include Chess Monthly  and Bridge Monthly, Chess and Bridge is now set up in London.
