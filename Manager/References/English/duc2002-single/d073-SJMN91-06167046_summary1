Mount Pinatubo exploded today, hurling ash and gas over 12 miles high.
Heavy rains  drenched the area, raising fears of catastrophic mudflows.
Thus far, at least four people have died, 24 have been injured, and about 84,000  evacuated since Pinatubo began erupting Sunday after six centuries of dormancy.
President Aquino dismissed a British newspaper report that the U.S. had warned of  possible radioactive contamination if the volcano damages nuclear storage sites at Clark  AFB which was abandoned Monday by nearly 15,000 Americans.
Foreign Secretary Manglapus said that the eruption should not effect current talks on new  leases for Clark and Subic.
