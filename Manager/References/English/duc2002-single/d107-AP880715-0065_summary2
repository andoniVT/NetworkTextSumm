Climatologists meeting at a symposium sponsored by the Weather Channel warned that  public concern over the drought will end with improvement in the weather.
Many of the  13 climatologists and meteorologists meeting at the symposium agreed that the earth's  temperature is rising but were unsure if this were a short tem or long term phenomenon  but stated that policymakers need to begin to deal with its possible effects.
Stating that  our reliance on fossil fuels must be reduced, Alan Hecht, director of the National Climate  Program said we must become more energy efficient and seek alternative energy  supplies.
