According to Niranjan Thapa, Nepal's minister of state for home affairs, 21 of Nepal's 75  districts suffered extensive damage in Sunday's earthquake on the India-Nepal border.
In  Nepal, over 450 were killed and up to 1,000 were injured.
Indian officials reported at  least 200 dead and over 2,000 injured, most by collapsing buildings.
Officials in both  countries are still awaiting reports from remote areas.
The quake, measuring 6.5 on the Richter scale, was the region's deadliest since 1950  when a temblor in Assam, India killed, by official count, 1500.
Rescue operations are being hampered by the monsoons that began in June.
