Lucille Ball died early today at 77.
Her abdominal aorta ruptured while she was  recovering at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center from heart surgery.
Tributes began flowing in  immediately including ones from former President and Nancy Reagan, Dick Van Dyke,  and the chairman of CBS Inc.  Miss Ball created a legacy, both as a comedian and a TV  entrepreneur, that has not been matched.
Her "I Love Lucy" was one of the most popular  shows ever, revolutionized TV production, and is still being seen in 80 countries.
She  began as a model and appeared in 75 movies before moving to television with Desi  Arnaz.
