Shahin Gobadi, spokesman for the People's Mojahedin of Iran charged that the Iranian government is deliberately underreporting the number of casualties from the massive earthquake that struck northern Iran.
He claims the government fears a political backlash and is fearful of public outrage.
The government says that 36,000 have died but Gobadi's organization estimates the number closer to 100,000.
Gobadi said that shoddy housing in which the government forced people to live caused the widespread loss of life.
His listeners cheered and chanted but spent little time expressing sympathy for the victims.
Gobadi's group helped depose the Shah, but played no role organizing the Islamic republic.
