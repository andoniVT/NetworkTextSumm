More than 100 people were feared drowned after an overcrowded ferry sank at a river  junction in southern Bangladesh.
It was carrying more than double its authorized  capacity of 100 passengers when it sank in 22 feet of water.
Those on the ferry's roof  swam to safety, but most of those in the hull drowned.
River pirates attacked another  ferry, throwing six people overboard.
The pirates, who had boarded the ferry as  passengers, open fire and exploded bombs as people were bedding down for the night.
The attackers, who made off with about 83,000 in local currency, escaped in waiting  boats.
