A drug that eases the heart's workload can cut the risk of new cardiac attacks and death  by 20 percent in people recovering from heart attacks.
The drug, Verapanil, a calcium  channel blocker is about as effective as another variety of blood pressure medicines  known as beta blockers at protecting people after heart attacks.
Since beta-blockers are  generally not recommended for people with emphysema and asthma, it is important to  have alternatives.
Next, researchers plan to study clot-dissolving drugs to see what effect  they have on unstable angina, a condition in which people suffer spontaneous chest pain.
