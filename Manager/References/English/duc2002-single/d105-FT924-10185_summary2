Over the weekend Russia dispatched 3,000 special troops to halt ethnic fighting in the  troubled Caucasus Mountains.
Inguish rebels in North Ossetia were reported to have  taken hostage 80 Interior Ministry soldiers based in the region.
The Inguish, a regional  ethnic group, are demanding return of lands that Stalin expropriated and declared part of  North Ossetia.
This was the second recent troop deployment.
Last week soldiers were sent to help crush  a coup attempt in Tajikistan.
Several other ethnic conflicts are continuing in republics of  the former Soviet Union that are located in the Caucasus Mountains.
