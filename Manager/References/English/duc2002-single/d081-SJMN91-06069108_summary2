A one-day coal miners' strike in Kazakhstan and the Ukraine has spread to all of the country's  major coal regions.
It is the new union's first major test of strength.
The larger 1989 strike  made only economic demands.
The government has not kept promises to raise miners' living standards and this time they also  want three major political concessions.
First, "real sovereignty" for the 15 Soviet Republics;  second, more power for the Federation Council which includes republic presidents; and finally,  they want a "low on property" defining what belongs to the government and allow private  ownership of land and industry, including some mines.
