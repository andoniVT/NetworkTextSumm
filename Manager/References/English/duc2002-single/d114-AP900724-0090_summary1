Indian frontier guards killed 20 Moslem militants as they crossed the border from  Pakistan on Monday, according to an Indian official.
AK-47 rifles, machine guns and  ammunition were seized.
The last week, 80 militants have been killed along this frontier.
India had increased patrols, claiming Moslem separatists were going into Pakistan for  training and arms and infiltrating back into the trouble India state of Jammu-Kashmir.
Pakistan denies these charges, but supports the separatism as self-determination.
Since  January, 863 people have been killed in the crackdown on the separatists.
Originally  seeking union with Pakistan, the separatists now want to establish an independent, neutral  country.
