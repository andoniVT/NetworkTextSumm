Mikhail Gorbachev said that thousands of striking coal miners and other workers are  urging railway employees to join the work stoppage and the unrest threatens economic in  the Soviet Union.
The number of striking mines in Ukraine, the country's top coal  producing region, increased from 20 to 58.
The miners are demanding more local control  over their industry, as well as higher wages and better living conditions.
Negotiators  have resolved most of the minors demands, including those on pensions and overtime,  but others will take up to a month to settle.
Central authorities are reluctant to give miners  more control over their industry.
