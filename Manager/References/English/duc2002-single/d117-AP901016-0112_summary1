Critic and novelist Antonia Byatt was named winner of the 1990 Booker Prize.
The five  judges awarded the 39,000-dollar prize Tuesday at a banquet held at Guildhall, the seat of  the Lord Mayor.
The winning novel "Possession" tells how two graduate students piece  together the relationships and lives of two imaginary Victorian poets from fragments of  their letters as they traveled across England to France.
The judges said Byatt's novel won only by majority vote after a spirited competition.
The Booker Prize is sponsored by Booker, an international food and farming business.
