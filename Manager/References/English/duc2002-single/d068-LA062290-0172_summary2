Today in a moving ceremony  Checkpoint Charlie, the Berlin Wall border post, was  hoisted by crane onto a flatbed truck to be taken to a museum.
Checkpoint Charlie,  constructed after the erection of the Berlin Wall in 1961, was a symbol of the Cold War.
British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.  Shevardnadze praised the end of a legacy of confrontation which had required the  checkpoint.
Former West German Chancellor Willy Brandt, who as mayor of West  Berlin had challenged erection of the wall in the early 1960's, was also in attendance.
Hundreds of excited Berliners leaned from balconies and windows to cheer.
