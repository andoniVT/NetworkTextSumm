Margaret Thatcher barely survived a vote of confidence by her party colleagues in the  House of Commons.
The narrow margin of her victory over former defense minister  Michael Heseltine means Thatcher will face a second round of voting on Thursday.
Mrs.  Thatcher has served longer than any other prime minister in this century, steering her  country through a war with Argentina and reversing Britain's economic decline.
Even so,  after 11.5 years, the negative aspects of Mrs. Thatcher's tenure are likely to overshadow  her accomplishments and her re-election is hardly assured as polls indicate the Tories  would do better without her in the next election.
