The engineer of a ferry that sank off a Red Sea port, leaving more than 400 people  missing, denied accusations of widespread negligence on the part of the ship's crew.
Investigators were looking into complaints from some survivors that the crew abandoned  the ferry without helping passengers and that some crew members pushed passengers  aside to get to the lifeboats.
The ship's engineer acknowledged misconduct by some  crew members, but said the survival of only 10 of the 71 member crew, indicated  negligence was not widespread.
The ferry hit a reef and quickly sank.
The ferry was  returning to Egypt from Jiddah, Saudi Arabia.
