Guangdong Province Governor Zhu Senlin, inspecting flood control and relief work in  Qingyuan city yesterday, said the Beijiang and Xijiang rivers were receding from their  record levels.
He attributed the province's success in combating the flood to the  concerted efforts of locally stationed soldiers stationed and residents.
More than 200 people died, 189,000 rooms were destroyed, and 1.2 million hectares of  crops ruined in flooding due to successive torrential rainstorms in the river valleys this  month.
The economic losses were set at 10.2 billion yuan.
The reservoirs, however, remained intact and Guangzhou, the capital city, and Zhujiang  River Delta remained safe.
