Leonard Bernstein, 70, returned to Carnegie Hall with the New York Philharmonic  Monday, 45 years after his triumphant debut with the orchestra.
Three Bernstein  compositions, all played stunningly, formed the program.
At intermission, Mrs. Arthur  Rodzinski, widow of the  Philharmonic music director who hired Bernstein as his  assistant in 1943, was introduced.
Violinist Jacques Margolies, who played in that first  concert, is still a member of the orchestra and played Monday night.
Eight others who  were members in 1943 went on stage.
Bernstein, in his 1,215th appearance as Philharmonic conductor, received a silver box  engraved with a reproduction of Monday evening's program.
