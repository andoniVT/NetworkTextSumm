An Iraq-Kuwait crisis erupted July 17 when Iraqi President Saddam Hussein accused  Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates of costing his country $14 billion in lost revenue  because of their overproduction of OPEC oil limits.
He further demanded $2.4 billion for  oil allegedly stolen from a common field and the cancellation of $15 billion in war loans  that Kuwait gave to Iraq.
Through mediation by Saudi Arabia and Egypt, Kuwaiti and  Iraqi officials met in Jiddah to negotiate issues.
Meanwhile, Iraq massed 100,000 troops  and 300 tanks on Kuwait's border.
Iraq has historically laid claim to all of Kuwait.
