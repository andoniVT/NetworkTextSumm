Thunderstorms generated floods which surged through a valley into the Ohio River town of Shadyside killing at least 11 people.
Fifty-one are missing and scores homeless.
Ohio governor Celeste declared a state of emergency and said that the valleys were choked with debris.
Many people came to the Shadyside disaster center hoping to learn of the missing.
Officials from Ohio, West Virginia, and the Coast Guard searched the Ohio River for survivors and bodies.
A flood watch, but not a warning, was issued before the disaster.
About 5.5 inches of rain had fallen in a little more than three hours.
