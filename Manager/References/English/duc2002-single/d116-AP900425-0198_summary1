The $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope left the shuttle Discovery's cargo bay on  Wednesday, nearly two hours and one orbit late, for orbit 380 statute miles above the  earth's distorting atmosphere.
It took three attempts to deploy the telescope's second  solar array panel, thus causing the delayed release from Discovery to operational orbit.
Suited astronauts were standing by to manually unfurl the solar panels if necessary.
Next, after first testing the telescope's maneuverability, the 10-foot aperture door will be  opened on Friday, exposing the finely polished 94.5-inch mirror to starlight.
NASA  expects its first images from space on Tuesday.
