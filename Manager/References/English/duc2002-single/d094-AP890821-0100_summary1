Emperor Hirohito left $13.06 million in taxable property.
It was the first time that the tax  authorities have disclosed the amount of a Japanese emperors taxable estate.
Until the  end of World War II, emperors were regarded as living gods.
Hirohito died of cancer at  the age of 87 and was succeeded by his son, Akihito.
Akihito has paid $2.99 million in  inheritance taxes on his half of his father's estate.
The other half of the estate went to his  mother who as Hirohito's spouse, was exempt from paying taxes.
Hirohito's estate  included stocks and other personal belongings.
State treasures were exempt.
