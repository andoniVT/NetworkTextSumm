A Florida couple survived for 66 days at sea in a rubber lifeboat after whales sank their pleasure boat.
As the boat was sinking, they grabbed fishing rods and a salt-water purifier and stayed alive by eating raw fish and drinking purified water.
William and Simone Butler   lost about 50 pounds each and were weak but recovering at a hospital in Costa Rica.
A Costa Rican Coast Guard ship rescued the couple who said several whales attacked and sank their boat.
A US Coast Guard spokesman said that boats sometimes run into marine mammals but knew of no recorded cases of whale aggression.
