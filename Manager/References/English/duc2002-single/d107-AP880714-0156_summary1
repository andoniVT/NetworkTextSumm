Today's 1988 Drought Symposium, sponsored by The Weather Channel, was attended by  13 state and national Weather experts.
David Rodenhuis, director of the federal Climate  Analysis Center in Washington, stressed the need to eliminate cause-and-effect  possibilities and extend the range of analysis.
Georgia state climatologist Gayther  Plummer thought the drought in the SE was related to the position of Jupiter, but  Rodenhuis remained skeptical.
Hurricane specialist John Hope suggested the SE drought  might be lessened or ended by a heavier than normal hurricane season.
Some SE states  get as much as 25% of their rainfall some months from hurricanes.
