The National Hurricane Center provided life-saving information as Hurricane Hugo  moved across the Caribbean toward the Carolinas.
Forecasters, with the aid of  satellites and computers, calculated where the hurricane would strike so that  emergency operations could get underway in those areas.
The center personnel  felt the word did not get out in the Caribbean, but were reassured by the  response in the Carolinas where proper response probably saved hundreds or  thousands of lives.
By the time Hugo hit Charleston the center's big job was  done.
Early today there were no immediate reports of deaths despite widespread  damage in Charleston and coastal South Carolina.
