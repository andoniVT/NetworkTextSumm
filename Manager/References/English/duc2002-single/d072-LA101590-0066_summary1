Leonard Bernstein, the Renaissance man, died Sunday at 72 from lung disease.
He had  remarkable talent and expertise in conducting, composing, playing the piano, and  teaching, which he combined with a unique theatrical flair in both his professional and  private lives.
He was born of Russian Jewish immigrants, began the piano at age 10, and  was educated at Boston Latin School and Harvard University.
He was mentored by the  great musicians of the era.
Perhaps his greatest successes were conducting the New York  Philharmonic and composing "West Side Story" for Broadway.
He was a heavy smoker  and drinker with an uproarious, liberal, life style.
