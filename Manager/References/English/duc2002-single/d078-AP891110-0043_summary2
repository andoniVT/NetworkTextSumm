Federal judge Laughlin Waters ruled Thursday that the Oscar statuette itself has no  copyright protection.
The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences had sued  Chicago-based Creative House Promotions, manufacturer of an employee-incentive  trophy called the Star Award, for copyright infringement.
The Star Award depicts a  naked, muscular male similar to the Oscar but two inches shorter and holding a star  instead of a sword.
The judge said the statuette became part of the public domain prior to  Jan 1, 1978, the effective date of the Copyright Act of 1976.
From 1929-1941, Oscars did  not bear the symbol denoting copyright.
The academy will appeal the ruling.
