Marco, a feisty boxer, walked off with the champion's trophy at Israel's dog-of-the-year  contest held in Tel Aviv's Exhibition Center.
This sanctioned, two-day international  event gave about 20,000 people the opportunity to see about 800 pretty pouches of more  than 50 breeds.
However, organizers conceded there were few if any contestants from  abroad.
The "intefadeh", the word used to describe the 9-month-old wave of Palestinian  violence in Israel, may have drastically reduced this year's foreign competition as  compared with a similar show last year.
Still, for dog lovers, the show briefly pushed  Israel's general elections out of the limelight.
