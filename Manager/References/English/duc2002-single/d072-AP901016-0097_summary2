Brilliant and flamboyant Leonard Bernstein, the first internationally acclaimed American  maestro, was buried today at Greenwood Cemetery in Brooklyn.
He died Sunday at 72 of  lung failure.
Flags at Lincoln Center, home of the New York Philharmonic which Bernstein conducted  from 1958 to 1969, were lowered in his memory.
The Philharmonic will perform an all  Bernstein program beginning Thursday and continuing through Oct. 23.
A memorial  concert is also planned for Nov. 14, the 47th anniversary of Bernstein's Philharmonic  debut.
In addition to conducting and composing, Bernstein introduced thousands to classical  music through his Emmy-winning television program, "Young People's Concerts."
