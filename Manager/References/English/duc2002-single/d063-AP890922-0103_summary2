An explosion at the southern England town of Deal leveled a two-story barracks at the  Royal Marines School of Music and seriously damaged many homes in the  neighborhood.
The band was playing at the time of the explosion and was trapped under  the wreckage.
The blast, an act of the Irish Republican Army, left 11 dead and 22  injured.
Terrified neighbors, some of whom said the blast reminded them of the Blitz,  were just starting their day when the explosion occurred.
Homes were wrecked as roofs  were torn off, ceilings tumbled down and windows were blown out.
