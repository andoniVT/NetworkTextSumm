In a move regarded as without precedent, the attorney general will apply for an injunction to stop  the production of a West End show about the late Robert Maxwell.
He was prompted by fears the  musical might prejudice the criminal trial of the publisher's sons, Kevin and Ian.
Lawyers say it  is no more unprecedented than the brothers having to commute to their trial past the theater  advertising the story of their father.
Press coverage of the late publisher has already caused concern to the Maxwell brothers'  lawyers.
The show's producer said the show would go on while he contests the injunction.
