Most of the student body are children of  Southeast Asian refugees.
The quarter who came to school today were escorted past  reporters.
Flowers and an anti-racism banner adorned the entrance.
Counselors assisted  children in each classroom.
Each child was given a stuffed animal at the principal's  office.
Purdy, a troubled loner with a history of alcoholism and brushes with the law, had  wandered America looking for welding work.
Toy soldiers were found in his Lodi motel  room.
