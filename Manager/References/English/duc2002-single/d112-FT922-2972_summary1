About 20 banks were concerned last summer at the behavior of businesses run by Robert  Maxwell before his empire collapsed.
Although concerned about the impact of late payments, the  banks did not discuss those concerns with each other.
The banks were involved in a flurry of  foreign exchange deals in which the Maxwell Communications Corporation (MCC) would buy  currency in one financial center while promising to make payment in another center.
Several  times, MCC received the currency but didn't make the payment, thereby giving themselves an  unauthorized loan.
Last year, MCC made many repayments to banks by looting pension fund  assets.
