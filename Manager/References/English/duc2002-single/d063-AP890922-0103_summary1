An explosion this morning destroyed a military barracks that housed the Royal Marines  School of Music.
The School is located in the southern England town of Deal, and police  there said the explosion killed 11 and injured 22.
The Irish Republican Army claimed  responsibility for the explosion.
The blast occurred while the school's neighbors were still in bed, or at home preparing  for the day's activities.
Some homes in Deal were badly damaged.
Neighbors described  the horror and confusion that followed the explosion, and likened it to those that occurred  during the Blitz.
