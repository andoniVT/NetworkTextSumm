US Navy aircraft helped search for 471 missing from the ferry Salem Express, which  sank Saturday night in shark-infested Red Sea waters.
Some of the 178 survivors said the  crew abandoned them.
The 1,105-ton Egyptian-registered ferry, completing a 36-hour  trip from Jiddah, went down six miles off the Egyptian coast after inexplicably leaving  standard navigational channels and ramming a coral reef in stormy 10-foot seas.
According to press, the vessel was taking a shortcut.
Authorities warned it back on course  but winds sent it out of control.
All but 10 passengers were Egyptians, many Muslims  returning from pilgrimages to Mecca or guest workers returning from Saudi Arabia.
