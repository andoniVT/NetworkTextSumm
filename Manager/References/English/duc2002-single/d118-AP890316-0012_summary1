Some Republicans remain angered over the defeat of John Tower's nomination for secretary of defense and Senator John Warner said a "Tower standards" has been established and likely will be invoked whenever a Democratic target is spotted.
When it appeared certain that Tower would be defeated, he declined to withdraw and fought on saying that to withdraw would tarnish Bush's judgement.
The defeat, however, did not cost President Bush a program, or a major campaign pledge, or the support of voters.
Bush said the outcome would not hurt other issues.
Senator Sam Nunn believed that Bush's leadership had not been hurt.
