President Bush plans to name UN Ambassador Thomas Pickering as US envoy to India.
The UN role in resolving regional disputes is growing in importance, and the feud  between India and Pakistan could become the next nuclear standoff.
Pickering served in  the UN during the delicate negotiations that led to the coalition against Iraq, and served  as a US envoy to El Salvador in the 1980s, during Reagan's opposition to communist- backed Central American insurgencies.
He is sometimes criticized for liking media  attention.
Foreign Service Director Edward Perkins, US ambassador to South Africa in  1986 when the US imposed economic sanctions to end apartheid, is to succeed Pickering  at the UN.
