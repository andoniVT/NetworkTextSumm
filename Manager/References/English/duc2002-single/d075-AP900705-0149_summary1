According to a study published in the journal Science, cardiac cell damage following a  heart attack may be limited by a natural substance called transforming growth factor beta.
In studies with rats induced to have heart attacks, those rats receiving injections of TGF  beta had 50 percent less cell damage than those not receiving the injections.
TGF beta is  normally present in heart cells but is missing from rat heart cells damaged by the  simulated heart attack.
The extent of heart cell damage was determined by measuring the  amount of creatine kinase in the heart tissue.
Hearts damaged by a heart attack tended to  lose creatine kinase.
