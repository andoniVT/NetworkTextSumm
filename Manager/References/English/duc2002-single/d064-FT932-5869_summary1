As the value of the rouble plunges, Russian officials feel thankful to McDonald's, who  opened their first restaurant in Moscow 3.5 years ago.
McDonald's of Canada opened a  second restaurant in Moscow, along with a 12-story office block.
It provides service  jobs, gets most of its supplies from inside Russia, and operates using the rouble rather  than dollars.
However, although the first Moscow McDonald's restaurant is the world's  busiest, the plunging rouble, high inflation and constantly changing tax rules have been a  challenge to McDonald's management.
They have no idea of when they will recoup their  $50 million investment.
