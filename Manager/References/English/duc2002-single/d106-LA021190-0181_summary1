Nelson Mandela joined the African National Congress in 1944 at age 26 and became active in black protests and civil disobedience to fight apartheid.
He was often arrested by the South African government and finally received a life sentence in 1964 for sabotage and conspiracy.
In 1985, then President Botha offered to release him if he renounced violence.
Mandela refused.
Mandela was celebrated outside South Africa on his 70th birthday but South Africa banned local celebrations.
While in prison, Mandela contracted tuberculosis but was treated and recovered.
President Frederik de Klerk released Mandela from prison in February 1990.
