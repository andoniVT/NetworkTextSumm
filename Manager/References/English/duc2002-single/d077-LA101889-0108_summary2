A reporter at Candlestick Park Tuesday night when the earthquake hit first thought a low- flying jet had passed overhead.
The stadium shook and the special concrete joints  strategically spaced around the top of the stadium to prevent earthquake damage did what  they were designed to, opening and closing as if the stadium was cardboard instead of  concrete.
There was no great alarm or panic because the quake didn't last long.
Those on  upper levels seemed more shaken than those on lower.
A few people ran out of the  stadium, but most waited in their seats to hear if Game Three of the World Series would  be postponed.
