The earthquake that hit Iran early Thursday exacted particularly large casualties  because people were asleep in fragile homes built on a flood plain of loosely deposited  soil that shifts in an earthquake.
The quake, measuring 7.7 on the Richter scale, hit a  mountainous section of coastal Iran at 12:30 a.m. and was the most powerful ever  recorded in that area where two major plates of the earth's crust meet.
Most structures  in the area are built of a ceramic-type brick or adobe that collapses easily.
At least  25,000 died and thousands were injured as residents were buried in the rubble of their  homes.
