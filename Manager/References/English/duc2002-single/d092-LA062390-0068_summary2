The US government has joined with private humanitarian groups to send aid to earthquake-ravaged Iran.
The government gave $300,000 of supplies, including hard hats, leather gloves, face masks, wool blankets, and tents.
Delivery of the goods would probably be by private charters rather than military transports which would normally do the job.
Death count from the earthquake stands at 29,000 and about 400,000 are homeless.
Charitable organizations across are collecting money for Iranian relief.
The American Jewish World Service is in a quandary wondering if they should provide assistance since Iran has excluded Israel as a source of aid.
