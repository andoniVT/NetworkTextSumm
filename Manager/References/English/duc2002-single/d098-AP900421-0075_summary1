The countdown began Saturday for launching of Space Shuttle Discovery on its mission  of hoisting the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) into orbit above the earth's atmosphere.
Launch is scheduled for 8:31 a.m. EDT Tuesday.
The $1.5 billion telescope is expected  to start providing significant scientific data in a month or two.
HST is considered to be  the greatest advance in astronomy since Galileo first used a telescope in 1609.
It may  help test the theory arising from the work of Edwin P. Hubble, for whom it is named,  that the ever expanding universe was created by a tremendous explosion some 15  billion years ago.
