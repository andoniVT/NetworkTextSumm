A one-day strike by coal miners in Kazakhstan and the Ukraine has grown into a  nationwide walkout involving up to 100,000 miners demanding that President Gorbachev  surrender power to the restive republics.
Most of the country's 1.2 million coal miners  are still working, but output in some key regions has been halved.
The strike is the new  union's first major test of strength.
It began as a warning in Kazakhstan and the Ukraine    but gradually spread to all of the country's major regions.
Previous strikes have made  only economic demands.
This time the miners want political concessions.
