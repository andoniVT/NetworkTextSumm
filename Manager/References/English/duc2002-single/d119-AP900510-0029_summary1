The Bush administration, eager to have an ambassador in Nicaragua now that Violeta  Chamorro has taken over after 11 years of Sandinista rule, is expected to name career  diplomat Harry Shlaudeman to the post.
It had planned to send Melissa Wells but feared   a prolonged confirmation fight because she was a previous target of conservatives.
Shlaudeman, 64, previously ambassador to Argentina, Peru, Brazil, and Venezuela, is  expected to win easy Senate confirmation.
He agreed to the job only after being  personally asked by Bush.
The Sandinistas expelled eight US diplomats in July 1988 for  interfering in the country's internal affairs, and the US expelled eight Nicaraguan envoys  in return.
