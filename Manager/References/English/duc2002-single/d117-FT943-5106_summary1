Yesterday' announcement of the short-list of six contenders for the1994 Booker Prize  elicited some biting comments.
Some of those on the list were characterized as "B-Team  Writers at the Best".
This is surprising in a year of good works of fiction that meet the  criteria for Booker consideration in that they are written in English and are non- American.
They are missing from the short-list, making the criticism more strident.
Despite the carping, there will be the usual high interest from now until 11 October when  the winner is announced.
