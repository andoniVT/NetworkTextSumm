Soviet physicists, in a rebuff to the Soviet Union's scientific establishment, voted on  Friday to nominate Andrei Sakharov to be a candidate in the March parliamentary  elections.
The overwhelming vote, taken in secrecy, came only two days after the  Governing Board of the Academy of Sciences rejected Sakharov's candidacy.
The vote was more an expression of respect for Sakharov than a specific endorsement of  his political views.
Sakharov used the occasion to outline a detailed program that would  transform the Soviet Union.
Complicated voting procedures still make it uncertain that  Sakharov's name will appear on the ballot.
