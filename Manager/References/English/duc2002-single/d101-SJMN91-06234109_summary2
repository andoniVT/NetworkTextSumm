Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev was said to be back in power today as the coup against him  collapsed.
The coup, one of the most tumultuous developments in recent Soviet history,  unraveled in a series of swift and dramatic developments.
Tanks moved away from the Russian  parliament, scene of the worst violence of the coup.
The national legislature demanded  Gorbachev's reinstatement and nullified the coup leaders' decrees.
The Communist Party,  seeking to salvage its image, denounced the takeover.
The coup's failure dealt a fatal blow to high-level efforts to thwart reform drives by Gorbachev  and Boris Yeltsin.
However, Latvia joined Estonia in declaring independence from the Soviet  Union.
