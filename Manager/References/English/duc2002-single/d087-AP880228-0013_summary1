The United States' Debi Thomas' dream of Olympic gold crumbled Saturday as East  Germany's Katarina Witt won her second straight Olympic championship and Canadian  Elizabeth Manley took home the silver.
Thomas won the bronze despite three faulty  landings.
Thomas, of San Jose, Calif., the first black to win a U.S. figure skating crown  and the 1986 world champion, skated poorly Saturday after doing well earlier in the  games.
Brian Boitano of the U.S. won the men's figure skating crown.
In the pairs  competition, a bronze went to a U.S. team.
The U.S. also captured three speed-skating  medals, a gold, silver and bronze.
