According to biographer Albert Goldman in his book The Lives of John Lennon the late, former Beatle spent much of a three-year period sitting in his room in the lotus position and smoking marijuana.
Between 1976 and 1979, Goldman writes that Lennon "could not be more remote".
Lennon was an anorexic, the eating disorder traced to a comment that he was "the fat Beatle".
The book claims that Lennon's second wife, Yoko Ono, had a $5,000 a week heroin habit and that John also took heroin and consumed LSD.
Goldman quotes Lennon as saying about LSD "I just ate it--like candy".
