John Major's public image as a wimp may have changed following a candid interview  with Michael Brunson, ITN's political editor.
Major used a variety of epitaphs to describe  certain colleagues who are not his favorites.
It is a change that comes too late.

In reality, the language of all  politicians, including Major, changes when they speak in private.
Gone are the crafted  sentences as a certain saltiness creeps in and the politicians swear and joke.
