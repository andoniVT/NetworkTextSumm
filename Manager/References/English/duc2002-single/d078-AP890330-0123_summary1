Future Academy Award shows should take a cue from Spencer Tracy's acting technique,  "less is better."
Wednesday's show was too long (necessary to accommodate all the  $375,000 30-second ads), had too many production numbers, and there were too many  awards with meaning lost to the general public.
The brightest moments of the 61st  Awards came from Billy Crystal, Robin Williams and Bob Hope, but they were too  brief..Other observations on the show: Most heartfelt acceptance: Dustin Hoffman Most intelligent acceptance: Jodie Foster Warmest reception: Lucille Ball and Bob Hope Least promising rock singer: Rob Lowe Worst reader of teleprompter: Walter Matthau
