Three of President Bush's ambassadorial nominees won narrow approval from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
Democrats said the only qualifications of the three were political connections.
Those nominees were Joseph Zappala for Spain, Marvin Sembler for Australia, and Della Newman for New Zealand.
Senator Paul Sarbanes led the opposition in committee and vowed to carry the fight to the Senate floor.
The committee routinely approved Shirley Temple Black for Czechoslovakia.
Other ambassadorial approvals were Thomas Melady to the Vatican, Keith Brown to Denmark and Joseph Gildenhorn to Switzerland.
William Howard Taft IV was approved to be US representative on the council of NATO.
