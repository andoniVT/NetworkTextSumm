Conductor Leonard Bernstein has cancelled several performances in Japan due to  exhaustion and lingering illness.
He will return to the United States to recuperate.
His  doctor announced he never fully recovered from ailments he suffered in the spring and  needs complete rest for an extended period.
Bernstein had been scheduled to conduct the  London Symphony Orchestra in four performances in Japan and appear with young  musicians during the Pacific Music Festival.
He inaugurated the festival last month,  believed to be the first festival in Asia where young musicians can train with a  professional orchestra.
Bernstein issued a separate apology to his fans and sponsors.
