Mount Pinatubo erupted late Wednesday and early today forcing another evacuation of  Clark AFB.
Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology Director Raymundo  Punongbayan said more eruptions, at least as severe, are expected within three days.
Most of the 16,000 Americans on Clark departed Monday.
Those evacuated today were  security volunteers.
U.S. officials will not comment on whether nuclear weapons are  stored at Clark, but they deny the suggestion that molten rock falling on base weapons  depots would create a radiation danger.
Thus far, two fatalities have been attributed to the eruption.
Over nineteen thousand  people have been evacuated from nearby villages.
