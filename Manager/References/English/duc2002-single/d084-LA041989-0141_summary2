An explosion rocked the battleship Iowa today, killing 47 sailors.
The explosion occurred  in a gun turret as a 16-inch gun was being fired during a training exercise about 330 miles  NE of Puerto Rico.
The Iowa, in no danger of sinking, headed back to Roosevelt Roads  Naval Base after the crew extinguished the fire that broke out.
The aircraft carrier Coral  Sea came to assist.
The Iowa dates from WWII and was put back into service in 1982.
Its  guns are original equipment.
Gun operation requires 60-70 men, with 20-30 in the turret  and others below sending up shells and 110-pound bags of gunpowder.
