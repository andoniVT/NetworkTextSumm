Hurricane Gilbert's growth baffles forecasters.
On 3 September it was a dry low-pressure  trough--one of 50-60 a year--west of Africa.
By Tuesday night it was an intense storm  with the lowest barometric pressure--26.13 inches--ever recorded.
Why did Gilbert  strengthened and others not?
Scientists do know that budding storms need to be off the  equator and are fueled by winds converging where there is high moisture in the lower  atmosphere.
Clouds may form and the air mass starts spinning, moving heat to the upper  atmosphere.
The warm September waters in the Caribbean can cause the storm to  explode.
