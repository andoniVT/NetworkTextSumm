Following his takeover of the unprofitable New York Daily News, British publisher Robert  Maxwell plans to raise about #250 million ($448 million) through the sale of shares in his Mirror  Group Newspaper Ltd. of Britain.
Mirror's flagship publication is the tabloid Daily Mirror.
In other changes, his son Ian, appointed Deputy chairman of Mirror Group, will resign his post  as Joint Deputy Managing Director at Maxwell Communications whose management will be  taken over by his brother Kevin.
Robert Maxwell bought Mirror Group in 1984 for #113 million and built it into one of Britain's most profitable newspaper groups.
