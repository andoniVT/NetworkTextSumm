New, tougher tax laws on what can be claimed as business entertainment expense haven't  slowed demand for tickets to Sunday's Super Bowl XXI.
Now, only 80% of the face  value to tickets to sporting events can be deducted, and then only if a substantial business  discussion occurs.
The face value of a 50-yard-line seat at the Super Bowl is $75, not  $1500, the going rate.
Meals are 80% deductible if business is discussed.
Still, hundreds  of companies will send their officials and customers to Pasadena for a weekend of  partying.
The IRS will have difficulty disputing claims that business was discussed.
