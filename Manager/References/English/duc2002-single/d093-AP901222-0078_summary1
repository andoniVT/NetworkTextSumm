The Israeli ferry Tuvia capsized shortly before midnight, throwing more than 100 men  into the cold waters of Haifa bay.
At least 19 sailors drowned and scores were injured.
The sailors who were returning to the USS Saratoga from Christmas shore leave, were  part of the multinational force arrayed against Iraq.
The boat was taking on water and  then capsized when it was hit by a big wave.
Survivors spoke of struggling to escape the  sinking boat and stay afloat until rescue came.
One rescue boat, already overloaded,  dragged some of the sailors through the water to the Saratoga.
