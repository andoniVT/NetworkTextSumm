Poland's Solidarity Government's first definitive statement on the issue of a reunified  German state said such a state "must be formed gradually and respect Poland's borders".
Some right-wing West German politicians have called for recovering the 40,000 square  miles of territory that Germany lost to Poland at the end of World War II.
The territory is  about one-third of present-day Poland.
East and West Germany have each separately  recognized the present border, but there has been no official assurance that a reunified  Germany would.
Poland's Foreign Minister Skubiszewski reassured Poles that its  government will insist on current borders.
