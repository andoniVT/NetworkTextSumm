The Ostwind, a yacht built for Adolf Hitler, was sunk to commemorate the "Voyage of the Damned" in which a ship carrying over 900 Jews escaping the Holocaust was turned away and forced to return to Europe and to Nazi concentration camps.
The ship was intended to become part of a coral reef.
However, the barge carrying it dropped it mile from the intended site threatening a delicate coral reef and sea life.
Event sponsors blamed the barge captain for the error.
The Ostwind must be moved or cut to pieces to avoid becoming a hazard to ships heading to Miami.
