Over several hours on Thursday Emperor Hirohito's blood pressure fell from 132 over 60  to 112 over 50 and his pulse dropped from 104 per minute to 84, according to Imperial  Household Agency spokesman Kenji Maeda.
Maeda said the emperor's blood pressure  has returned to its normal level, but that the intestinal hemorrhaging that began a month  ago resumed Thursday and the pace of the discharges was quickening.
Hirohito, 87, has been bedridden for a month.
He has received nearly 22 pints of blood  since his illness worsened Sept. 19.
A palace source said he gets 600-700 calories a day,  intravenously.
