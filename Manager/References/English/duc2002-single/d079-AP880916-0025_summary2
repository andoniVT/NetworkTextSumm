Thousands of residents along the Gulf of Mexico fled on Thursday to higher ground as  the first storm from Hurricane Gilbert arrived in Brownsville, Texas.
A hurricane  warning has been issued for the southern half of the Texas coast with a hurricane watch  to the Louisiana border.
National Guard units have been deployed.
Gilbert is now a  Category 3 storm, but at one point was the most intense in history and wrecked havoc  across the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Jamaica, and the Cayman Islands.
On Wednesday  it barreled into Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula knocking out communications, electricity,  and water supplies.
