Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said the drought could cause crop acreage controls to  be eased next year to help rebuild US grain inventories.
More US territory suffered some  degree of drought in May and June than at any point on record.
On July 2, 35% of the  contiguous US was experiencing severe to extreme drought, compared to 60% in 1934  and 50% in 1954.
Because of the extensive early season drought, this year's total affected  area could set new records.
However, there will still be adequate supplies of food grains  and livestock feed to meet domestic and export demands.
Consumption will be less  because prices are higher.
