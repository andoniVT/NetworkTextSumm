President Bush has named career diplomat Deane Hinton as ambassador to Panama.
Hinton replaces Arthur Davis, recalled last May in protest when Noriega stole  Panamanian elections, and sent back after the December invasion and president Endara's  installation.
Hinton was a recess appointment, meaning he can serve until the end of next  year without Senate confirmation.
Hinton, 66, has been assistant secretary of state for  economic and business affairs, US representative to the European Community, and  director and economic counselor of the State Department's Agency for Economic  Development in Chile and Guatemala.
He was ambassador to El Salvador from 1981-83  and has been ambassador to Costa Rica since 1987.
