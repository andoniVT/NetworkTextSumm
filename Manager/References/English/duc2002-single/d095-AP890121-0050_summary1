Family and friends mourned the loss of the five children slain during recess at Cleveland  Elementary School.
Their killer, Patrick Purdy, was buried quietly in a nearby town.
Purdy opened fire at the school on Tuesday with an AK-47, killing the five students and  wounding 29 others and one teacher.
Cleveland School serves California's third largest  community of refugees from Southeast Asia.
Although the five children killed as well as  19 of the wounded were Asian, authorities did not see this as a racist crime.
Teachers and  counselors are working to allay the fears of the children returning to school.
