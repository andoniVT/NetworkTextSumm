East Germany's deposed Communist leader, Erich Honecker, has been declared too sick to be in  jail but fit enough to be tried.
He is still recovering from kidney cancer surgery in January.
A  medical panel concluded that seven other former Communist officials--all close aides to  Honecker--were fit to prosecute and to be placed in custody despite advanced age and poor  health.
Along with Honecker, they are charged with corruption and abuse of office.
Honecker has been staying at a Soviet military hospital outside East Berlin.
Although their poor  health often disrupted proceedings, investigations against the former East German leaders will  continue.
