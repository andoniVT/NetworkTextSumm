In the most recent violence in Kashmir, Moslems blew up a truck killing three soldiers.
In other incidents, militants killed a Moslem said to be a police informer and another died when caught in exchange of gunfire between militants and security forces.
Moslem snipers fired on security forces during a five-hour curfew relaxation called to allow people to shop for essentials.
The curfew had been imposed after security forces killed 49 Moslem demonstrators marching into Srinagar to participate in a demonstration to demand independence for the predominantly Moslem state.
At least 171 people have been killed in the violence since January 20th.
