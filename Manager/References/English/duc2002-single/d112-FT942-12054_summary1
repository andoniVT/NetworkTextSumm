Trustees filed two writs last week in Manhattan for Mirror Group Newspaper Pension Scheme  and Maxwell Communications Corporation Works Pension Scheme.
The writs allege that  Goldman Sachs, the US-based investment bank, assisted in diverting currency from the two  Robert Maxwell-controlled pension schemes to ensure its own debts from Maxwell interest  would be repaid.
The writs center on the purchase of #55 million of MCC shares from the pension schemes of the  two Swiss trusts which were transacted through Goldman.
Allegedly, Kevin Maxwell told  Goldman to remit the proceeds of the sale to a trust Goldman knew to be Maxwell owned.
