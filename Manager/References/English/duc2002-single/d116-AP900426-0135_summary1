Ground controllers at the Goddard Space Flight Center finally made contact with the  Hubble's two main antennas after trying for more than six hours to lock on.
The  telescope's two low-gain antennas, which can be used in an emergency, were working  well.
A Goddard spokesman said a pointing problem and the inexperience in dealing  with a new spacecraft was the cause.
The shuttle Discovery will follow 46 miles behind  the Hubble, NASA's most expensive unmanned spacecraft, until controllers are sure it is  operating properly.
An earlier problem with unfurling a solar power panel was resolved.
The next milestone is opening the aperture door.
