Just a year after winning the general election, a surprise to everyone, Mr. John Major  enters the second year of his term as a deeply unpopular leader.
The honeymoon  following his victory was short lived and his past year has been marked by a number of  controversies.
These controversies include internal party differences over Europe, the  debacle surrounding Britain's withdrawal from the exchange rates mechanism of the  European Monetary System, as well as a deep and continuing recession.
The recession  has alienated many of his allies in the business community.
Major is seen as a weak  leader without a clear political agenda.
