A ceasefire in Moldova was threatened when a truck driver transporting militiamen was killed by machinegun fire in the self-proclaimed Trans Dnestr republic, home of the Russian-speaking minority.
The ceasefire was between the Moldavan authroities, dominated by ethnic Romanians, and the so-called Trans Dnestr republic.
The conflict, stems directly from the breakup of the Soviet Union, unlike the more serious strife in Nagorno-Karabakh where tension between Azeris and Armenians has existed for centuries.
Moldava came under Soviet control in 1944 and the Soviet government sought to stifle any links with Romania.
Ukrainians and Russians together represent 27% of the population and Moldavans 64%.
