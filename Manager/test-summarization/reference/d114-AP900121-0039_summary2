Fighting between police and Moslem separatists in Srinagar, the summer capital of the Jammu-Kashmir state killed at least 21 and wounded 100.
Police had imposed a 24-hour curfew to quell the violence resulting from the militants, led by the Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front, holding anti-India demonstrations.
However, crowds defied the curfew.
Heavy rains caused fighting to taper off but the situation remains tense and dangerous.
Both India and Pakistan claim parts of Kashmir in a dispute that started after the state was partitioned in 1947.
Most of the population of Kashmir is Moslem while Jammu is predominately Hindu.
