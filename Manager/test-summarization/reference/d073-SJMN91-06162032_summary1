Clark AFB, Philippines, was evacuated today after gases, ash and rock spewed from  Mount Pinatubo located 10 miles from the U.S. base.
Philippine Institute of Vulcanology  and Seismology Director Raymundo Punongbayan warned that bigger eruptions would  follow.
Subic Bay naval base will house the nearly 15,000 evacuees.
Fifteen hundred  troops remained at Clark to provide security.
Since Pinatubo began erupting last week,  Philippine officials have evacuated more than 12,000 people in three provinces.
Pinatubo  is in the "Ring of Fire" that circles the Pacific.
Mount Unzen in Japan, also in the ring,  erupted a week ago, killing 38 people.
