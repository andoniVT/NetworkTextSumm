Rescue workers coped with aftershocks and heavy rain in their efforts to reach remote  Himalayan region victims of an earthquake whose official death toll neared 700, with at  least 2,000 people injured in India and 1,000 in Nepal.
Although the intensity of  aftershocks is lessening, people remain frightened.
In Nepal's cities of Katmandu and  Biratnagar, and in Patna, India, rumors of expected new quakes sent thousands of people  into the streets.
Indian and Nepalese military and police helped with relief efforts.
Nepalese officials said many offers of assistance had come from abroad but no decision  was made about accepting them.
