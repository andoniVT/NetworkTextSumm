Republican vice-presidential candidate Dan Quayle, a 1969 DePauw University graduate,  underwent six months of Indiana National Guard training then was hired as a research  assistant by the Indiana Attorney General's office, in an interview arranged by an  employee of his grandfather.
Quayle helped handle consumer complaints in the spring of  1971, and was chief investigator of the new Consumer Protection Division from July to  mid-September, when he became administrative assistant to the governor while attending  Indiana University Law School.
1980 campaign descriptions of Quayle as a "Vietnam-era  veteran" were dropped after objections by combat veterans.
"Active National Guard duty"  referred to basic training and 15 days of camp each summer.
