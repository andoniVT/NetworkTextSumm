An Iraqi airways jet arrived today in Amman, Jordan, carrying 78 foreigners.
This is the  first commercial flight out of Iraq since it invaded Kuwait and the U.N. Security Council  banned all trade and military ties with Iraq.
Thousands of Westerns have been stranded,  including passengers of a British Airways flight.
Many of those passengers, including 28  Americans, are in Baghdad hotels.
About 1,000 people a day are reported fleeing Kuwait  through the desert to Saudi Arabia.
Iraq has closed its borders with Jordan, which has been  asked to facilitate the exit of American diplomats and their families from Baghdad.
