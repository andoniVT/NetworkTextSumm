Twenty-three sailors from the Star of Alexandria, a 652 foot freighter, were rescued  Monday evening 400 miles southeast of Cape Cod.
Two other crew members were  missing.
The ship could not be spotted, and apparently had gone down in rough seas.
The  sailors in a lifeboat used a radio dropped by a Coast Guard aircraft to contact the  merchant ship Ravenscraig that rescued them.
The Star of Alexandria was built in 1966, and was registered in England.
It was designed  to carry bulk freight, and was carrying cement from Athens to New York when it went  down.
