Fifty-nine people drowned Sunday afternoon when a  Caribbean passenger ferry sank  while being towed into port by a tugboat.
The ferry Justo Rufino Barrios II ran out of fuel  midway on its regular 16-mile run across Amatique Bay, from Livingston to Puerto  Barrios.
Vicente Daudi, a 40-year-old Spanish citizen, was killed and two of his  daughters are missing.
Daudi was working with a Spanish technical aid and economic  development mission in Guatemala.
Navy patrol boats, fishing vessels, and private craft  have been searching for survivors.
Puerto Barrios, 187 miles NE of the capital, is  Guatemala's principal east coast port.
