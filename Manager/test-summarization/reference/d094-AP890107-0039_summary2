United States, New Zealand, Filipino, and Australian leaders mourned Emperor Hirohito,  dead today at 87, but reaction in South Korea and Taiwan was cool.
The South Korean President sent his condolences, but a government party statement  added, "We reserve further comment..." Japan forcibly annexed the peninsula in 1910  and ruled until the end of WW II.
Taiwan does not enjoy diplomatic relations with Japan, therefore, there was no official  Taiwanese statement, but the Chinese daily United Evening News said, "Now Hirohito  has died.
We may not want to collect the reparations, but we shall never forget the painful  historic lessons."
