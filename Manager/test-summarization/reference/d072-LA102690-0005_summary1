Tom Tugend paid tribute to Leonard Bernstein in his Letter to the Editor of the Los  Angles Times.
He describes his memory of the Renaissance man of music.
In October  1948, Tugend was an American volunteer in the Israeli army during its War of  Independence.
He attended a performance of the Israel Philharmonic with Bernstein as  guest conductor.
The audience of patrons and soldiers was hearing an emotional  Beethoven's Fifth Symphony.
Toward the end of the first movement, machine-gun fire  broke out in the old city and continued intermittently through the performance.
"Lenny  and the orchestra, never missed a beat."
