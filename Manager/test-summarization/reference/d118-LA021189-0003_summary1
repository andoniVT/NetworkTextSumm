The Senate panel weighing John Tower's nomination for defense secretary has found a substantial discrepancy in his description of his business dealings with British Aerospace.
He told the committee that he represented that company on civil aviation matters and not on military systems.
But in a divorce deposition in 1986, he said that he represented that firm on a range of military problems.
This discrepancy prompts concerns not only about his veracity but also whether he should have registered as a lobbyist under the Foreign Agents Registration Act.
The FBI is looking into new charges about Tower's alleged drinking, womanizing, and receipt of campaign contributions.
