Deaths from heart and blood vessel disease dropped 24% over the past decade.
But it  remains by far the nation's largest killer.
Experts attribute the decline to a combination  of healthier living habits, including fewer cigarettes, better food and improved medical  treatment.
Statistics show that more than one in four Americans suffer from some form  of cardiovascular disease and half of these will eventually die from it.
Since 60% of  heart attacks occur before the victim reaches the hospital, a major goal is getting people  to go to the hospital at the first sign of a heart attack.
