A tornado carved a three-mile stretch of destruction in Huntsville, AL.
It killed 17 people,  injured 463, and left 1,000 homeless.
It was one of a series that touched down Wednesday in an  arc spanning the Deep South to the Midwest causing at least 19 injuries and far-flung damage.
Seven thunderstorms are crossing the Northeast, and tornado watches have been put out to states  in the area.
The tornado that struck Huntsville was Alabama's deadliest since a 1975 twister killed 22 people  in Birmingham.
No serious damage was reported from NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center  and the Army's Redstone Arsenal.
