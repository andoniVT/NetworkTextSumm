The Discovery crew deployed the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) on Wednesday but  stayed nearby in case there was trouble opening the aperture door.
The door was  opened Friday morning, exposing the telescope's finely polished 95.5-inch eye to  starlight for the first time.
When the door opened, however, two of HST's four position- stabilizing gyroscopes stopped working.
Engineers got the gyroscopes back on line, but  there were still problems with linking the high-speed dish antennas with a relay satellite  so the planned release on Tuesday of HST's first test image has been delayed.
Scientific data will follow in a month or two.
