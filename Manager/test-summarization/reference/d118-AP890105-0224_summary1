Former Senator John Tower, the defense secretary-designate had surgery for removal of a colon polyp.
Preliminary biopsy showed the polyp to be benign.
Tests of the growth showed it to contain some "malignant but well differentiated cells".
The ex-senator is expected to make a full recovery.
Tower went into business as a defense consultant after he left the Senate in 1985, having served there for 24 years.
He has also served as an arms negotiator for President Reagan and he headed the White House's Iran-contra investigative panel.
President-elect Bush named Tower as his defense secretary on December 16th.
