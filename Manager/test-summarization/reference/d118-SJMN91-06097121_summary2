Former Texas Senator John Tower was killed in a plane crash as it tried to land on Sea Island off  the Georgia coast.
The crash also clamed the life of Tower's daughter, Marian, as well as  Astronaut Manley Lanier "Sonny" Carter, Jr., and Dr. Nicholas Davies,  president-elect of the  American college of Physicians.
The cause of the crash is not immediately known and follows  the plane-helicopter collision which killed Sen. John Heinz of Pennsylvania and six other  people.
Sen. Tower was rejected as President Bush's candidate for defense secretary in 1989.
President Bush called the death a great loss.
