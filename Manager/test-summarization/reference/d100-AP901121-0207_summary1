In the summer of 1980, drummer Andy Newmark was asked to play in John Lennon's  new album.
Lennon had been in seclusion for five years, but in 1980 felt inspired to  make an album with his wife Yoko Ono.
Newmark spent a month in the studio playing  the songs that eventually ended up on "Double Fantasy" and "Milk and Honey",  Lennon's final albums.
It was Newmark said, the highlight of my career.
Prior to  meeting Lennon, Newmark was nervous about working with him, but found that Lennon  was just a "working musician".
It took Newmark a long time to recover from Lennon's  death.
