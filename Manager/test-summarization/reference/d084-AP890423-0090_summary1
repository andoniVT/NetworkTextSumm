About 3,000 people welcomed the USS Iowa back to Norfolk Naval Base Sunday.
Sailors wearing black arm bands lined the rails of the ship which had an explosion in its  No.
2 gun turret Wednesday during exercises near Puerto Rico.
Forty-seven crewmen  died.
Eleven people inside the turret, all on the lowest deck loading powder from the  ship's magazines, survived, the Navy said.
Two of the 11 survivors stood atop the fire- blackened turret at the docking.
On Sunday the Navy released a videotape of the explosion which was taken by a  crewman who was recording the firing of the big guns.
