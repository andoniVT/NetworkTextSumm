A freighter with a cargo of beer sank today 28 nautical miles north of the Ameland, a  Dutch island in the North Sea.
This is an area of heavy freight traffic.
The ship sank  about 12:45 P.M. in high winds.
A West German helicopter from the island of Borkum,  30 miles from where the ship went down, took the crewmen ashore.
The Coast Guard identified the ship as a Finnish-registered freighter, but did not identify  it by name.
The ship's origin and destination were not provided.
Earlier reports had  identified the ship as a passenger ferry.
