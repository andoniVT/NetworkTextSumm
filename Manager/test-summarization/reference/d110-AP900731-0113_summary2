Iraqi and Kuwaiti negotiators met privately in Jiddah on Tuesday to defuse their border  and oil dispute as 100,000 Iraqi troops massed on the border.
Another meeting is  scheduled for Wednesday.
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein touched off the crisis on 17 July when he accused  Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates of exceeding the quotas of oil production set by  OPEC, and said Kuwait was illegally pumping oil from a field that straddles an unmarked  border.
Iraq has historically laid claim to all of Kuwait, and has coveted two Kuwaiti  islands that command Iraq's only access to the Persian Gulf.
