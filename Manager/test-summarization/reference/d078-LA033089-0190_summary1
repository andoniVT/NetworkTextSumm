At Wednesday's Academy Awards, "Rain Man" won four Oscars and "Dangerous  Liaisons" and "Who Framed Roger Rabbit" each won three.
Seven other films also each  won one award.
Ten movies split 17 awards, the most winners for one year this decade.
Refreshingly, several winners came from films that were not box office smashes: Jodie  Foster as best actress ("The Accused"); Geena Davis as best supporting actress ("The  Accidental Tourist"); sound editing for "Bird;" and David Grusin's score of "The  Milagro Beanfield War."
The 1988 slate of films was a marked improvement over recent years and reflected an  older, more demanding audience.
