The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences recently sought court protection for  Oscar, its famous award, with mixed results.
After The Collector's Book Store  announced a February auction of the 1957 best-picture trophy, the Academy won a court  order temporarily blocking future auctions.
But, the Academy lost a copyright  infringement suit against Houston International Film Festival in which it claimed that the  festival's Lone Star Statuette was an Oscar clone.
These efforts against commercialization notwithstanding, Coca Cola Co.is stocking the  limousines of celebrities attending this year's award ceremony.
With the limousine doors  open, the Coke logo will be clearly visible.
