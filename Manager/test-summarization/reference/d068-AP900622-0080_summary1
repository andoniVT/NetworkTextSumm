As the U.S. Army band played a song about old Berlin, a crane hoisted the rectangular  white sentry station known as Checkpoint Charlie onto a waiting truck.
For 29 years,  Checkpoint Charlie served as the Allied checkpoint at the only place between the Berlins  that could be crossed on foot by non-Germans.
Citing Checkpoint Charlie as a symbol of  the Cold War, Secretary of State Baker hoped its removal would "bury the conflicts it  created."
Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze called for the removal of Berlin's status  as an allied controlled city.
All borders between the Berlins are to be opened on July 2nd.
