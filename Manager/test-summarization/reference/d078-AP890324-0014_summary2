The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences tries to keep Oscar's sheen from  being tarnished by commercialism, even though it itself suggested limousines bringing  celebrities to the awards have door-mounted coolers bearing the Coca Cola logo.
It  criticized MGM-UA for touting "Rain Man" nominations before they were made.
Oscar  sales have brought over $17,000 for heirs or friends, but the Academy sued to block  future sales, insisting winners agreed not to sell the trophies without first offering them to  the Academy for a nominal fee.
The Academy lost its suit claiming the Houston  International Film Festival's similar Lone Star Statuette was a copyright infringement.
