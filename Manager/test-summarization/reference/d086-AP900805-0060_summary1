The United States urged U.N. members to impose broad economic and military sanctions  on Iraq.
The world body is expected to do so.
The U.S. had circulated drafts of a  resolution calling for an embargo on Iraq's oil exports, an embargo on imports to Iraq,  and a halt to all arms and military supplies to Iraq.
Kuwait's U.N. ambassador said that  the Iraqi-installed government was employing "pure blackmail" by saying it could not  ensure the safety of foreigners if their governments support sanctions.
The U.N. role in  the crisis assumed increasing importance after divided Arab nations cancelled an  emergency summit on the invasion.
