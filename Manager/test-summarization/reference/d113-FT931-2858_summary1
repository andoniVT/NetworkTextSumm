Despite a bomb attack last Friday,  the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) reopened  Monday with the BSE index rising by 5.6 per cent by Tuesday.
Another bomb blast in  Calcutta caused nervous selling yesterday and the index fell by 2.1 per cent to  2,409.23.
The Bombay equity market experienced unusually bullish speculation before  the national budget was announced on February 27.
Then the finance minister  disappointed traders by postponing corporate tax reforms by a year and leaving the  short-term capital gains tax for local investors at 44.5 per cent.
Heavy selling drove  down equity prices to a 13-month low with the BSE reaching 2287 on March 10.
