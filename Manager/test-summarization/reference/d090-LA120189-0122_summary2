Filipinos clashed Thursday at the consulate in Los Angles over the military coup  underway in their homeland.
One group, in sympathy with the coup leader Lt. Col  Gregorio Honasan, held a candlelight vigil outside, then several people entered the  consulate and confronted the acting consul general.
They decried government corruption  and incompetence and demanded President Corazon Aquino resign.
Aquino supporters,  who had just completed a news conference, loudly defended the government and its  institutions and began chanting "Cory!"
Their leader said he believes most of the  350,000 Filipinos in Los Angles County oppose the coup and called the military  dangerous.
