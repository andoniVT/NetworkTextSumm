Florencio Abad, the Philippines land reform secretary-designate, resigned on Thursday,  undermining President Corazon Aquino's commitment to agrarian reform, once the  centerpiece of her administration, and highlighting administration problems.
Abad's  problems began in January when he tried to stop the leasing of land, which he thought  should be distributed to peasants, to a Japanese corporation.
A compromise was reached,  but landowners in Congress were alarmed and blocked Abad's confirmation.
Many  question Aquino's true stance on agrarian reform.
She is from a landlord family, heavily  influenced by her brother, and had turned land reform details over to Congress, which  loaded the program with loopholes.
