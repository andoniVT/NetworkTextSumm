Although Therapist Kee McFarlane defended her work in the interviewing of hundreds of  children for the McMartin Pre-School molestation trial, jurors were critical of the  interview techniques.
The jurors, in acquitting the Buckeys on 52 of the charges,  felt that  leading questions were asked and that the children were never allowed to tell their own  story.
McFarlane is a social worker and director of the Child Sexual Abuse Center at the  Children's Institute International.
CII video tapes of the interviews were introduced as  evidence at the trial.
One juror said she would have believed the children more had the  tapes not been introduced.
