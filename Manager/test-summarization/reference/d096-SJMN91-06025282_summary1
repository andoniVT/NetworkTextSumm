Henry Carley, president of Tampa's local chapter of the NAACP, is co-chairman of one of the  feature events of Super Bowl week, the Bambaleo Parade, an extravaganza with marching bands,  a street festival, and floats.
Carley's efforts calmed a racial dispute over Tampa's traditional  white-dominated Gasparilla Parade, which had to be cancelled.
The Super Bowl Task Force this year named two black men to head a community-relations  committee.
Carley said there is much more involvement this time, black and white, than the  1984 event.
There will be an event saluting black sports legends.
Several minority-owned  businesses won lucrative contracts with the NFL.
