Leonard Bernstein, the first internationally acclaimed American maestro, was buried  privately today beside his wife at Greenwood Cemetery in Brooklyn.
Flags at the  Lincoln Center, the home of the New York Philharmonic, were lowered in his honor.
The Philharmonic plans an all-Bernstein program through October 23.
A memorial  concert is also planned at Carnegie Hall on November 14.
A gymnastic conductor, he  also composed classical and popular music, and introduced thousands to classical music  on his television series.
Musical director Zubin Mehta and Larry Kert, who first played  Tony in Bernstein's "West Side Story", praised him today.
