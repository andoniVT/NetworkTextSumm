A flash flood Thursday night sent a wall of water 15 to 20 feet high through communities  along the Ohio River, killing at least 10 people and leaving 40 to 60 missing, authorities  said.
The flood occurred after thunderstorms Thursday night dumped about 4 inches of  rain in about an hour.
Two creeks outside of Shadyside, Ohio overflowed, knocking homes off their  foundations and washing away a Shadyside bar filled with people.
Gov.
Richard Celeste declared a state of emergency.
The Shadyside Fire Department established a command center at the Jefferson  Elementary School to coordinate rescue efforts.
