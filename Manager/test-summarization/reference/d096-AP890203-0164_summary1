President Bush at an East Room reception congratulated the San Francisco 49ers on their 20-16  Super Bowl victory.
Surrounded by 49ers, Bush said they rewrote the record books and raised  football to a new level of excellence.
Quarterback Joe Montana said being invited to the White  House "meant a lot to us all... Not very often do I get to see these guys in ties."
Bush was presented with autographed footballs by Montana and wide receiver Jerry Rice, who  won the game's MVP award; a Super Bowl ring by team owner Danny DeBartolo; and a 49ers  jogging outfit by Coach Bill Walsh.
