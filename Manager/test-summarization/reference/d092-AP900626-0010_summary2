Americans haven't responded with donations for Iranian earthquake victims as quickly as they did for the Armenian victims a year and a half earlier.
However, relief agencies expect contributions to pick-up.
An associate director of World Concern, a private relief agency said there is "a hierarchy of responsiveness" for Americans.
According to him, Europe gets a very large response, Asia a pretty good response, but the Middle East lags.
The first shipment of US aid, delivered by AmeriCares arrived in Iran on Sunday.
It was the first to be accepted by the Iranians since the hostage crisis of 1979-1980.
