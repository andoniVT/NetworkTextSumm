Thousands of John Lennon fans attended a benefit concert in his hometown, Liverpool, honoring the late, former Beatle.
Proceeds will go to the Spirit Foundation, the charity founded by John and Yoko two years prior to his murder by Mark Chapman in New York.
Many musicians from the US and Britain performed at the concert.
The other former Beatles did not attend, but Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr sent taped messages.
The musicians all assembled on stage for "Give Peace a Chance".
The concert concluded with a recording of Lennon singing "Imagine" as giant screens showed a video featuring John and Yoko.
