Paul Weyrich, president of the conservative Free Congress Foundation testified at the Senate Armed Services Committee that John Tower's behavior makes him unfit to lead the Pentagon.
Weyrich says that Tower may lack the "moral character" to be secretary of defense and cites lack of sobriety and womanizing.
Before this testimony, members of the committee and witnesses had praise for the former senator.
Other testimony raised questions regarding Tower's lucrative ties to defense contractors and past support for big defense budgets.
Senators Nunn and Warner have asked the White House if allegations against Tower have been investigated by the FBI.
