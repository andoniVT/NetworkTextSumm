Soviet President Gorbachev met Tuesday with East German Premier Modrow who said  that Gorbachev did not rule out the prospect of reunification, but did not set a time.
Gorbachev had earlier said that any decision on Germany must include inputs from the  Soviet Union, United States, France and Britain, and should not infringe on the interests  of neighboring states.
A senior West German leader said on Tuesday that Gorbachev had adopted a "more  positive" attitude toward reunification, and that East Germany, because of its political  instability, must chose between unification and chaos.
