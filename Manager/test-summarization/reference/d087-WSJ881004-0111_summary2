The 1988 Olympic Games may have seen great performances by several US athletes, but they may not lead to lucrative endorsement contacts for those winners.
This is because Olympic gold may have lost its luster because of drug scandals.
Also, the games were far from home and poorly covered by NBC TV.
Unlike the 1984 Games in Los Angeles, which the USSR boycotted and the US dominated, the Seoul games had the Soviets and East Germans winning more medals than the US.
The US Olympians may get contracts to endorse specialized sports equipment, but the high-paying soft drink and fast food companies haven't called yet.
