A specialist in Soviet affairs has written an article asking the question: "Did Mikhail Gorbachev  orchestrate the coup that almost overthrew him?"
Some views supporting this conspiracy theory  are: Gorbachev ignored clear warnings about attempts to seize power; his description of his three  days under arrest in the Crimea invites the question of why his 32 guards didn't act against the  opposition delegation and why weren't they incapacitate; he may have sided with the  conspirators but waited out self-imposed confinement.
His motives were to ferret out disloyal  elements, make himself a hero, and delay signing of a treaty lessening his powers.
