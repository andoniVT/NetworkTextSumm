The 1988 New York City Marathon drew a field of over 23,000 runners.
It was the  largest field in the 19-year history of the marathon.
Steve Jones of Wales was the man's  winner, and Grete Waitz of Norway won the women's division for a record ninth time.
Enthusiastic spectators cheered all the participants, but were most interested in friends or  family who were participating.
More than 13,000 runners from 13 countries and 49 states ran the Marine Corps  Marathon in Washington, D.C.
Unlike most marathons, the one in Washington pays no  prize money to winners.
