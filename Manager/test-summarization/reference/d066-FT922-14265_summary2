Sam Walton's phenomenal success as a retailer stemmed from his personality, and his  willingness to defy accepted retailing wisdom.
By 1991 Wal-Mart was the world's largest  retailer, as measured by revenues.
His success made him very wealthy, but he did not  take on the trappings of the opulent.
Employee satisfaction was very important to him, and he instituted policies to keep them  happy.
He put his stores in small rural towns despite warnings that they would fail.
They  were a great success but often caused the failure of many small businesses.
