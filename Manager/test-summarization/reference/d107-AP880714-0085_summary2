Farmers could expect little relief from the drought in the near term according to weather  forecasters.
The outlook for the next 30 days to three months indicates that the areas  worst hit by the drought can expect little relief with chances of a less than normal amount  of rainfall  ranging from 55 percent in the major grain growing states to 70 percent in part  of southern California.
This news came as President Reagan headed to the Midwest to see  drought-plagued farms.
The current drought is not yet as bad as those suffered in the  1930s and the 1950s but does equal one in 1911.
