Floods lasting for ten or more days have brought heavy agricultural losses to Fujian  Province.
Among nine cities and prefectures there, those seriously hit are Sanming,  Nanping, Ningde, Fuzhou, Quanzhou and Putian.
Of these, Sanming was hit the worst.
In May the city suffered from heavy rainstorms and had big losses and it now suffers  again from the flood with some 600,000 mu of crops damaged.
Per capita possession of  cultivated land in Fujian is only 0.05 mu.
Even in normal years, grain output there is not  self-sufficient.
This consecutive flooding has made things even more grim.
