Investigators' search for the cause of Wednesday's explosion aboard the battleship Iowa   is hampered by the absence of eyewitnesses.
All who were in No.
2 turret's gun house  where the explosion occurred were killed.
The explosion followed the order to load and  prepare a gun for firing, and probably involved the sacks of gunpowder that are rammed  into a gun after it is loaded with a shell.
A moratorium was placed on firing 16-inch guns.
Former Iowa-class commander Adm. Richard Milligan heads the investigation.
Bodies of  the casualties -- one officer and 46 enlisted men -- were sent to Dover AFB, site of the  military's largest mortuary.
