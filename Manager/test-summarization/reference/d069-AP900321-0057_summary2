Edgar Bronfman, President of the World Jewish Congress, announced a scheduled  conference in the Berlin villa where Nazi leadership met to implement the "final  solution" against Europe's Jews.
The purpose is to formulate a formal declaration  regarding German reunification.
He said that a part of their planned moral statement to  be made on May 8 is to see that the Holocaust cannot happen again.
Bronfman said he  doesn't fear a resurgence of anti-Semitism from a united Germany; in fact, reunification  may cause a decline in anti-Jewish feeling.
They won't be blaming Jews for a divided  Germany, he explained.
