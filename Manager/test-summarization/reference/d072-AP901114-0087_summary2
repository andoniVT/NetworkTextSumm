Exactly 47 years after Leonard Bernstein debuted as conductor of New York  Philharmonic, the orchestra remembered the maestro at a concert that included selections  from his "Mass," "Chichester Psalms," and "Candide."
Mr. Bernstein died on October  16th.
Family members and friends of the world renown conductor introduced various  selections.
An international roster of musicians and singers joined the orchestra as guest  artists.
Conductors were Michael Tillson Thomas, Michael Barrett, Christoph Eschenbach and  James Levine.
The orchestra played the overture to "Candide" with a symbolically empty  podium, which brought tears to some of the invited audience and a standing ovation.
