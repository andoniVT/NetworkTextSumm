Iranian editorial writers are rejoicing that the rest of the world is waking up to one of their  most hated bogeymen--Saddam Hussein.
Saddam attacked Iran in September 1980 and the  war dragged on until August 1988.
For the last six months, editorial writers have backed  off Saddam because of U.N. sponsored bilateral talks.
The invasion of Kuwait changed  this.
The writers now are castigating Kuwait and the United States--the Great Satan--for  creating a Frankenstein by supporting Iraq in the war.
Some Iranian pundits believe this  will be an excuse for the United States to reenter the Persian Gulf.
