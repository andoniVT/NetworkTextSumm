As Hurricane Hugo's 135 mph wind roared outside, Charleston S.C.'s mayor Joseph P.  Riley, city officials and a few reporters stayed in Charleston's City Hall watching the  storm's fury.
The building's tin roof ripped off and water seeped down into the City  Council chamber.
Phone and electric service to the city command post was knocked  out.
When the eye of the storm passed, Riley took reporters out of the 188-year-old  building to look at the damage.
The tin roof was in the gutter, slate tiles were scattered  on the ground.
Bricks, sticks and leaves littered the street.
"It's scarcely a late summer  breeze," he commented.
