Sakharov's obituary was signed by President Gorbachev, five other politburo members,  and fifty other leading officials and scholars.
It was published in Pravda.
Such obituaries  are reserved for favored public officials, and Pravda emphasized Sakharov's importance  by printing the decree on the funeral commission on the front page.
The obituary praised Sakharov as a man of honesty and sincerity.
This amounted to a  public apology for the 1989 exile ordered by President Brezhnev.
Gorbachev now blames  Brezhnev for allowing stagnation and corruption to overcome the Soviet system.
Gorbachev called Sakharov in Gorky in December1986 and ended the exile.
