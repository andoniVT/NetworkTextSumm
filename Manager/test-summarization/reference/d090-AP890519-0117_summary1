President Corazon Aquino on Friday refuse to allow her predecessor, Ferdinand Marcos,  to return home to die and won't permit him to be buried here despite an appeal from his  wife.
The 71-year-old Marcos is in critical condition in a Honolulu hospital suffering from  renal, cardiac and pulmonary failure.
Mrs. Marcos' appeal was broadcast by a pro- Marcos radio station.
Meanwhile, pro-Marcos leaders warned the former president's death in exile would  trigger demonstrations.
Chief of staff, Gen. Renato de Villa, said the armed forces were  prepared to block any attempts by the opposition to foment trouble.
