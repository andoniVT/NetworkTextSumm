Senators are under pressure to take a stand on  Supreme Court nominee Clarence  Thomas.
300 black pastors of the Coalition for the Restoration of the Black Family and  Society held a pro-Thomas rally on the steps of the Supreme Court.
The Citizens  Committee to Confirm Clarence Thomas ran a television ad in four southern states  where senators face re-election next year.
On the other side, senators are receiving the  first of 500,000 anti-Thomas postcards provided by the National Abortion Rights Action  League and the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law announced that 86 of  about 110 members of its board of directors oppose Thomas.
