More than 10,000 coal miners in Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Indiana and West Virginia  walked off the job to express sympathy for miners in Virginia and West Virginia, who  have waged a bitter two-month strike against Pittston Coal Group.
Pittston dropped out  of the Bituminous Coal Operators Association to negotiate with the union independently  and the two sides have failed to reach an agreement despite 16 months of negotiations.
United Mine Workers officials gave conflicting indications of whether or not they are  responsible for the wildcat strikes.
The coal companies contend that walkouts at any  mines other than Pittston, violate the contract with the union.
