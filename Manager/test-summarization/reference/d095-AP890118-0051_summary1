The children of families who fled the horrors of the Vietnam War saw their schoolyard  turned into a killing field by a gunman armed with a rifle and a pistol.
When the shooting  was over, five children of Vietnamese and Cambodian descent were killed and the  gunman, Patrick Edward Purdy, lay dead from a self-inflicted gun shot wound, the rifle  and the pistol, with victory written on it, lay on the ground beside him.
Residents of  Stockton, the 40-year-old community where the shooting occurred, were stunned by the  shooting and questioned why such a tragedy had to happen.
