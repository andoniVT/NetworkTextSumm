Five hours after shuttle Discovery's launch Tuesday carrying the Hubble Space  Telescope, delayed since 1983, Hubble sent its first signal.
Hubble is hailed as the  greatest advance in astronomy since Galileo.
In its 15 years orbiting 380 miles above  Earth, its two cameras, two spectrometers, photometer, fine-pointing system, and 94.5-  and 12-inch mirrors can look 14 billion years backward in time.
Tomorrow, Discovery's  mechanical arm will lift the 12-ton, 43-foot long, 14-foot wide Hubble out of the cargo  bay.
Batteries will power Hubble until wing-like solar panels extend, with manual help if  necessary.
The $1.5 billion telescope cost $7 million a month to maintain on Earth.
