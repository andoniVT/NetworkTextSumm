An overcrowded ferry without life jackets capsized Saturday morning in the monsoon- swollen Ganges River.
The two-decker boat was in 12-30 feet of water 100 yards from  shore.
400 died, including 300 on the lower deck where women and children rode.
Five  hundred thirty-five passengers were aboard the 35-year-old steam-powered ferry  designed to carry 160.
Passengers protested when 150 wheat bags were loaded too.
Strong currents and poor visibility hampered rescue efforts.
The trip is used by Hindu  pilgrims crossing the river to a shrine.
This was India's worst ferry accident ever.
In July  1970, 150 died when a boat capsized in the Krishna River.
