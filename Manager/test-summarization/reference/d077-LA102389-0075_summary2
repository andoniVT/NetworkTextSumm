Charleston and San Francisco are united by suffering two of the century's costliest, back- to-back natural disasters, Hurricane Hugo and the Bay Area earthquake.
Both endured  disruption of normal life, destroyed buildings, billions in damages, loss of life, and  frustrating delays in getting federal assistance.
The two disasters were different because  Hugo gave Charleston warning.
Its damage was everywhere, over quickly, and  immediately evident, whereas earthquakes leave hidden damage and have aftershocks.
Charleston recovered slowly and disrupted communications left it isolated.
San  Francisco's earthquake was reported immediately and the city bounced back quickly.
Charleston lost no major lifeline like the Bay Bridge.
