20,000 attended Israel's dog-of-the year contest held in Tel Aviv's Exhibition Center.
The winner a feisty boxer beat out 800 other contestants representing more than 50  different breeds.
The event was sanctioned by the World Kennel Club based in Brussels  and had judges from the Netherlands, South Africa, Italy and Britain.
Although the  competition was billed as an international event, organizers conceded there were few if  any contestants from abroad.
This was in contrast to 1987 prior to the uprising known as  the intefadeh, when scores of foreign competitors participated.
Within Israel, the event  briefly outshone both the intefadeh and general election.
