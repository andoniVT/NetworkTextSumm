Danish studies of the drug Verapamil, a calcium channel blocker, show that the drug  reduces the chance of a new heart attack in patients recovering from a heart attack.
This  is the first trial to indicate that calcium blockers may be helpful after a heart attack.
Verapamil is about  as effective as beta blockers in protecting people after heart attacks  and may be useful in instances where beta blockers cannot be used.
Many people do not  tolerate beate blockers, especially those suffering from asthma and emphysema.
Verapamil was effective in decreasing mortality in the first 12 to 18 months following a  heart attack.
