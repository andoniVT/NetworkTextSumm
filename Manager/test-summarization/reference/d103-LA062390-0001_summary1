San Diego's Iranian community was in a anxious state after receiving word of the  earthquake in Iran.
Most of the 25,000 Iranians living in San Diego were told they would  have to to wait at least 48 hours for news of family and friends.
Mohammad Nyakoui was  more fortunate.
He had talked with his wife just before the earthquake and she was able  to call him eight hours after the earthquake to let him know that she and their two  children were alright.
The Iranian Community has begun to organize to receive donations  of money as well as food, clothing, and medicine.
