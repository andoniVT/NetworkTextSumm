The nonpartisan American Academy of Diplomacy rated Joseph Gildenhorn, Bush's  nominee for US ambassador to Switzerland, unqualified based on a comparison of his  biography and the job's requirements.
Gildenhorn and his family have given $230,000 to  Republican campaigns.
Twenty of Bush's first 29 ambassadorships have gone to large  GOP contributors.
Democrats complain that choice diplomatic posts are better reserved  for Foreign Service professionals.
Gildenhorn, 59, is a lawyer, real estate developer, and  vice-chairman of the board of directors of the Sovran Bank.
Other ambassadorial  nominees rated as unqualified include Joseph Zappala (Spain), Melvin Semble  (Australia), and Della Newman (New Zealand).
All are in real estate.
