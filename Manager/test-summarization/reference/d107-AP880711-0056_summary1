North America's crippling drought could result in food shortages for poor, food- importing countries facing high grain prices.
Food aid from developed countries could  also fall.
World cereal production in 1988 is expected to be 1.785 billion tons, only two  million tons more than last year's lower-than-expected production.
World grain stocks  will likely fall below 310 million tons, or 17% of the level necessary to safeguard world  food security.
The most severely hit crops are coarse grains (maize, barley, oats).
Good  harvests in Europe and Asia are projected, but locusts flourishing in unexpectedly heavy  rains have damaged sub-Saharan crops.
South American grain production should be  slightly lower.
