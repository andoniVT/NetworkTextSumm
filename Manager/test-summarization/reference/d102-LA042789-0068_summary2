Lucille Ball, who died in April 1989 at the age of 77, will long be remembered.
She  made her craft look easy, spontaneous and unrehearsed.
The result was the durable and  probably the finest series in television history, "I Love Lucy".
She had a successful career  in films before the she began the show in 1951 and they prepared her for television.
Indeed movie audiences stayed home in large numbers to watch her show.
Lucille Ball  was not of course Lucy, the lovable scatterbrain.
She was smart, hardworking and a  perfectionist in a tough business who knew that comedy was not accidental.
