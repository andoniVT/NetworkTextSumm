Virginia Thomas, the white wife of black Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas, is  a brainy lawyer with an impressive career.
Critics see her as a woman with strong  opinions on issues that are bound to come before the court.
Women's-rights activists  cite her opposition to comparable-worth legislation and some religious groups dislike  her anti-cult activities.
Some blacks feel the Thomases' marriage shows his rejection of  the black community.
But in the eyes of the Thomases they have stood for true equality  and rejected programs that actually harm women and minorities by lowering standards.
They advocate and live their belief in a colorblind society.
