Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s Visitors Center opens Wednesday, 40 years after Sam Walton  opened a business in the same building in Bentonville, Arkansas.
The center chronicles  the rise of the nation's fastest-growing discount chain.
After working for the J.C. Penney  Co. and a tour in the army, Walton opened a Ben Franklin Store in nearby Newport.
He  moved to Bentonville in 1950.
He opened more Ben Franklin Stores, but the company  did not like his plan for discount stores in rural areas.
Walton and his brother opened the  first Wal-Mart Discount City in 1962.
By  early 1990 Wal-Mart owned 1,402 stores and  employed 272,000.
