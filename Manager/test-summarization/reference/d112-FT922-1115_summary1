Michael Stoney, a senior executive in a number of Maxwell companies, and Kevin and Ian  Maxwell, the sons of the late Robert Maxwell, are named as the three top persons involved in at  least 28 "unusual" payments from Mirror Group Newspapers (MGN) bank accounts.
Accounts  notes show that MGN made extraordinary provisions of #421.5 million, including millions in  pension deficiencies and in transactions with Maxwell-controlled companies.
It is believed some MGN directors did not know there was anything improper about the  transactions.
They accepted assurances from the treasury department headed by Mr. Stoney.
Reportedly, the system had many weaknesses.
