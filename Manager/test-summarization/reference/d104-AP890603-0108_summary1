The confrontation between Chinese troops and hundreds of thousands of demonstrators  ended in the killing and wounding of untold numbers in Tiananmen Square.
The  protesters, mainly students along with some workers and intellectuals, finally were forced  to leave Tiananmen early in the morning of 4 June.
The bloody encounter was the climax of trouble that had been escalating since April.
As  early as 27 April more than 150,000 surged past police lines and filled Tiananmen  Square.
Other demonstrations followed, and the government imposed martial law on 20  May.
The students defied the government's order to leave, and blocked streets leading to  the square.
