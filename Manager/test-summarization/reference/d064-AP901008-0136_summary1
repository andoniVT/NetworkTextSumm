McDonald's fries and hamburgers came to China Monday where cooking has long been  considered a culinary art.
The 500-seat restaurant opened in Shenzhen, a special  economic zone near Hong Kong.
In Shenzhen the average worker earns $53 a month,  compared with $32 for many other Chinese.
It is a wholly owned subsidiary of  McDonald's Hong Kong, which in turn, is a 50-50 joint venture with McDonald's in the  United States.
Most of its ingredients are imported from Hong Kong but hopefully will  eventually come from China.
The restaurant's 240 staffers were gleamed from 9,000  applicants.
Taste test: "I like it."
