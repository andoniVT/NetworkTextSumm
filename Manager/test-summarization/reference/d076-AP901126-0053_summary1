Margaret Thatcher broke the mold in English politics when she became that country's  first woman Prime Minister.
Even so, critics say she did little to advance the cause of  women.
No believer in feminism, Mrs. Thatcher believed the battle for women's rights  had been won.
Women occupy 43 percent of the British workforce yet they generally are  paid less and are poorly represented in managerial jobs and parliament.
Supporters point  to Mrs. Thatcher's legislation on work place nurseries and independent taxation for  working women.
As prime minister, she angered feminists by emphasizing women's  roles as homemakers and care givers.
