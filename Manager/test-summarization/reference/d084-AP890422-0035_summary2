Crowds gathered on Norfolk's waterfront Friday for a memorial after Wednesday's  explosion aboard the Iowa.
President Bush will attend a ceremony for crew and family  members at Norfolk Naval Base Monday.
The exact cause of the explosion may never be  known because of the devastation, but investigators looking for clues studied a videotape  made by an officer to record firing of the big guns.
Deaths in upper turret chambers were  from the explosion and fire while those at lower levels were due to suffocation when the  blast sucked out oxygen.
Crewmen removed shells and powder from two other guns in  the turret after the fire was extinguished.
