Three thousand Russian Special Forces flew to the Caucasus region to halt ethnic fighting in North Ossetia.
Russian President Yeltsin sent the elite units to stop the fighting between Ossetians and another ethnic group, the Ingush.
Scores were reported killed or injured.
The Ingush are demanding the return of lands expropriated by Stalin in 1944.
The Russian action mirrored recent developments in the former Soviet Republic of Tajikistan, where Russian troops have also been deployed.
The Caucasus Mountains, are engulfed in several conflicts.
Among them are Georgia's war with Abkazian separatists, and Azerbaijan's conflict with ethnic Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh.
