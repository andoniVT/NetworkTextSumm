General Accident (GA), the leading British insurer, estimated yesterday that its losses  from Hurricane Andrew might reach $40 million; however, GA has only a half-percent  share of the Florida market and the estimate is based on the assumption that GA's catastrophe insurance would be triggered by the extensive claims.
The company's loss  adjustors guess that losses to all insurers might exceed $8 billion.
Other insurers have  estimated that losses from the storm that hit Florida and Louisiana might be anywhere  from $1 billion to $20 billion.
At this time no one is certain of the extent of losses.
