The longest, costliest, criminal trial in history ended Thursday when Ray Buckey and his  mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, were found not guilty on 52 counts in the McMartin  Pre-School child molestation case.
The jury deadlocked on 13 counts.
Buckey did not  comment, while his mother displayed anger.
The judge said he was not surprised.
Parents and jurors criticized the prosecution, which blamed the system.
The sordid case  began in 1983 and created a media frenzy and hysterical parents.
The 18-month  preliminary hearing brought 135 charges against seven people.
Many charges were  dropped, but the trial lasted more than 2 years.
