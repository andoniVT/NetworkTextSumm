Prime Minister John Major won the general election a year ago, but today he is a deeply  unpopular, unproven leader.
His party is internally torn over the controversy that  accompanied Britain's withdrawal of sterling from the European Monetary System and  by a lingering deep recession that has alienated many traditional supporters in business.
Most industrialists are grateful that he won the election and he is appreciated for personal  qualities that are favorably compared to those of his predecessor.
Unlike the former prime  minister, however, he is viewed as a weak leader, with little vision and no clearly  articulated political conviction.
