Prime Minister Thatcher's resignation took President Bush by surprise.
Thatcher had told  the world that she would fight to a second ballot.
However, after being told Wednesday  evening by her own cabinet officers that they could not support her in the second ballot  process, the decision to retire was her only option.
If someone was to beat Heseltine, it  wouldn't be Margaret Thatcher.
Mrs. Thatcher was a strong supporter of shared Anglo- American values.
Although she shared a special relationship with former President  Reagan, relations with President Bush were cool at first, warming gradually as the two  found common ground.
