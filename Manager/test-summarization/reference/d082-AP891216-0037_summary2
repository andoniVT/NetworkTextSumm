Andrei D. Sakharov, 68, died Thursday in his study, hours after urging creation of formal  parliamentary opposition to break the party's stranglehold on power.
Soviet leaders  eulogized him as an honest, sincere man who suffered great injustice.
An obituary signed  by officials and scholars appeared in Pravda and emphasized the importance of  Sakharov's 1975 Nobel Peace Prize.
At age 32 Sakharov became the youngest member of  the Academy of Sciences and joined the group that developed the Soviet hydrogen bomb.
He realized its danger and urged limited production and testing.
Breshnev exiled  Sakharov in 1980 for criticizing Soviet intervention in Afghanistan.
Gorbachev allowed  his return to Moscow in December 1986.
