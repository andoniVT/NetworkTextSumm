O Sunday Andrei Sakharov spoke in Milan to the Congress of the Italian Socialist Party.
He said the Soviet Union was on the brink of economic catastrophe because reforms were  moving too slowly.
Last month he was elected to the new Soviet Congress of People's  Deputies, a little more than two years after his release from internal exile.
The new course in international affairs, as exemplified by the withdrawal from  Afghanistan, please Sakharov, but economic conditions worry him.
He was also critical  of new legislation on personal responsibility, and the government's heavy hand in  suppressing dissidents in Georgia.
