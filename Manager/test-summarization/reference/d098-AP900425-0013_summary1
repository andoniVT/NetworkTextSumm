The long delayed launching of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) has evoked a burst  of superlatives from the nation's scientists.
From James Westphal at the California  Institute of Technology we hear, "No one ever made anything that good."
Edward  Weiler, the chief NASA scientist on the HST project declares, "On a clear, dark night  you can see a flashlight from two miles away.
With a 28-power telescope you can see it  on the moon 250,000 miles away.
With the HST you could see a firefly in Australia from  Washington."
Others hail HST as the greatest thing since Galileo's telescope in 1609.
