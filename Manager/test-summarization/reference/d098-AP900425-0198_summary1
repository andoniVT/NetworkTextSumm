After years of delay and a last-minute snag, the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) was  freed from the shuttle Discovery at 3:38 p.m. EDT on Wednesday and placed in orbit  380 miles above the earth, 70 miles higher than any shuttle has previously flown.
The  telescope's 10-foot aperture door is to be opened Friday exposing the finely polished  94.5-inch mirror to starlight.
NASA expects its first image from the telescope on  Tuesday.
The HST is named for the late American astronomer Edwin P. Hubble who  discovered during the 1920s that the universe was expanding, giving rise to the Big  Bang theory of creation.
