The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) orbited with its lens cover open Friday, but its  electronics were shut down due to a malfunction.
HST's 10-foot aluminum aperture  door was opened exposing its finely polished 94.5-inch mirror to starlight for the first  time, but problems with its high-speed antennas will delay the release of its first test  image which had been planned for Tuesday.
Scientific data will follow in a moth or two.
From its orbit high above the earth's distorting atmosphere HST will enable  astronomers over its 15-year lifetime to look back 14 billion years and possibly  determine the age of the universe.
