Hurricane Gilbert, after devastating Jamaica and then the Yucatan Peninsula, has been  downgraded from Category 5 to Category 3 but may again gather strength over water  while moving west-northwest toward landfall.
A warning has been issued for Mexico's  northern coast and the southern half of the 370-mile Texas coast.
The Texas Governor  dispatched the National Guard and has issued an emergency proclamation "to preserve  the health, safety and welfare of the public".
Homeowners are boarding up and laying in  supplies to protect against this massive hurricane, which, to date, has taken at least 47  lives in the Caribbean and caused over $8 billion in damage.
