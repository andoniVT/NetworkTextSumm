The United States has urged other U.N. members to impose broad economic and  military sanctions on Iraq.
A draft resolution calls for an embargo on Iraq's oil exports  and on imports to Iraq, and a halt to all military supplies for Iraq.
If the Security Council  approves  these sanctions it would be the first time since 1967 that it has taken such  action against a member state.
The Iraqi-installed government of Kuwait told other  countries to refrain from taking "punishing measures" against it or Iraq and threatened  that they "have to remember they have interests and citizens in Kuwait."
