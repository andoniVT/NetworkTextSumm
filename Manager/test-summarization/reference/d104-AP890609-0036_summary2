The pro-democracy banners and protesters' tents are now gone from Tiananmen  Square, replaced by tanks and drilling soldiers.
The replica of the Statue of Liberty is  gone, replaced by a tread-wheeled personnel carrier.
Poems and posters calling for a  more open China have disappeared and now 80 tanks and 40 armored personnel  carriers line the northern part of the square.
Much has changed since the military swept  into Beijing six days ago, and who knows at what cost?
The government says that  nearly 300 people, mostly soldiers, were killed.
Diplomats, Chinese citizens and  Chinese Red Cross officials estimate the death toll at more than 3,000.
