General Accident, the leading British insurer, said yesterday that the claims arising from  Hurricane Andrew could reach as high as $40 million.
If they do, "external catastrophe  reinsurance covers will be exposed", meaning General Accident can pass its losses on to  external reinsurers.
If this happens, the company will suffer a post-tax loss of $40  million.
This information was provided during an extraordinary shareholders' meeting  yesterday.
General Accident, with a branch in Orlando, has .5 percent of the Florida  market.
The company's adjusters estimate total insured losses may reach $8 billion,  within total damages of more than $20 billion.
