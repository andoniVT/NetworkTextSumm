Ever since the 1906 earthquake devastated San Francisco, many scientists believed the next "big  one" would strike the Los Angles area.
Their studies gave various interpretations of how much  stress was released by the 1906 earthquake (magnitude 8.3).
The greater the quake, the more  stress it relieves and, thus, the longer it takes for the same size quake to occur again.
In the face  of conflicting evidence, the US Geological Survey issued a 1988 report that concluded the 1906  quake didn't release as much stress in the San Francisco region as believed.
The 6.9 quake  Tuesday confirmed the USGS study.
