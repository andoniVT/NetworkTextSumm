Hurricane Hugo struck South Carolina Thursday after thousands of coastal residents  were evacuated inland.
By late afternoon the storm was upgraded to category 4.
Hurricane-force winds first hit the coast at 9:15 p.m. and by midnight 119 mph winds  were reported in Charleston and up to 135 mph as the eye passed nearby.
Hugo was  expected to turn north and cause severe flooding as it passed up the coast.
As of  Thursday evening about 12,000 people had checked into 83 shelters across South  Carolina.
A spokesman for the Red Cross said that tens of thousands of people were in  shelters along the Eastern seaboard.
