At the National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Florida, forecasters working 12-hour  days monitored Hurricane Hugo using computers and satellites.
They calculated where it  would strike and got emergency operations going in those areas.
Director Bob Sheets   appeared on TV all week and credited the ever-present but bothersome media with  getting the word out.
A hurricane warning, involving emergency preparations and  evacuation plans, costs $50 million.
Before the warning system was established, a Hugo- sized storm would have killed thousands.
So far there were no reports of coastal-area  deaths.
After Hugo's landfall, forecasters relaxed but still followed three other Atlantic  weather systems and one in the Pacific.
