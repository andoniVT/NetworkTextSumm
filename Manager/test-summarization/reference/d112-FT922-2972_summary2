In an effort to raise funds, Maxwell Communications Corporation made late payments on the  foreign market.
Called teaming and lading, Maxwell and his son Kevin began to buy and sell  enormous amounts of foreign currencies.
Maxwell would buy currency in one financial center  and promise to repay it in another.
MCC received the currency, but on a number of occasions, did  not make the payment, giving itself an unauthorized loan.
About 20 banks, including Lloyds,  Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, and Swiss Bank Corporation were involved in the exchange  deals.
At least 100m dollars in credit is thought to have been raised this way.
