Today's killings and flight of hundreds of thousands of protesters from Tiananmen  Square is the outcome of events beginning with the death of former Communist party  chief Hu Yaobang on April 15 this year.
By April 17 thousands of students were  marching in Beijing and Shanghai shouting "Long live Hu Yaobang!
Long live  democracy!"
During May the protest movement focused on Tiananmen Square after  about 2,000 students began a hunger strike there and a million citizens rallied to their  support.
When declaration of martial law did not intimidate the protesters the  government resorted to the massive use of troops and firepower.
