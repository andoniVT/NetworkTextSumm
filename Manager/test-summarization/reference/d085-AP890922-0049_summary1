Hurricane Hugo raged into Charleston Thursday night packing 135-mph winds.
Few  residents had experienced such a dangerous, killer hurricane, the first major storm to  strike the city since Hurricane Gracie came ashore 70 miles south in 1959.
In 1938, a  tornado tore through the city killing 32, injuring hundreds, and causing $2 million in  property damage.
The worst natural disaster to hit Charleston occurred Aug 31, 1886,  when an earthquake measuring 7.7 on the Richter scale claimed 110 lives, destroyed 102  buildings, and tossed most of the city's chimneys into the streets.
The city has survived  two wars and any number of smaller hurricanes, which residents call "September gales."
