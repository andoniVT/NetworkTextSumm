Soviet President Gorbachev after meeting with East German Premier Modrow on  Tuesday appeared to be more open toward eventual German reunification.
Gorbachev's  position appears similar to that adopted by the East German Communists when they  acknowledged unity as a long-term goal, but under no specific timetable.
Gorbachev said  unification decisions must include the four Allied powers and take into account European  opinions.
It now appears that unification is inevitable.
Count Otto Lambsdorff, head of  West Germany's Free Democratic Party, acknowledging Gorbachev's "more positive  attitude" urged "economic union" within 18 months as a prelude to full union of East and  West Germany.
