The San Francisco marathon is attracting many highly ranked women runners this year.
The women who didn't need any coaxing to participate in the event are looking toward  the Olympic trials, scheduled for January.
Most of the U.S. topped ranked women want  to run in a summer-time marathon and San Francisco has a challenging course.
In  addition its cool summer temperatures make it one of the few places where you can have  a marathon in the middle of the summer.
All seven of the highly ranked women runners  have run marathons in under 2 hours and 40 minutes.
