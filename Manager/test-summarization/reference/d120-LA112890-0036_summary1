Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major, 47, will succeed his mentor, Margaret Thatcher,  as Britain's prime minister.
Major, a high-school dropout, was elected Conservative Party  leader after Thatcher, failing to garner the necessary majority votes in a leadership  contest last Tuesday, resigned.
Though Major was two votes short of the required majority in yesterday's election, he  was elected leader of the ruling Conservative Party after his challengers, former Defense  Secretary Heseltine and Foreign Secretary Hurd, conceded defeat.
The Labor Party, just recently a strong favorite in the next election, is now in second  place behind a Tory party led by Major.
