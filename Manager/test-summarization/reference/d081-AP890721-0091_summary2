Coal miners in Siberia ended their strike today after exacting promises of better food, housing  and working conditions.
Despite announcements that President Gorbachev's concessions-- including granting miners greater control of their industry--apply nationwide, hundreds of  thousands of miners stayed off work elsewhere.
Strikes continued in the Donetsk Coal Basin and  Chervonograd in the Ukraine, the Karaganda region of Kazakhstan, and the Pechora Basin in  Russia.
Coal Minister Mikhail Shchadov said the government agreed to make all Soviet coal operations  economically and legally independent.
They will sell for negotiated prices but the Coal Mining  Ministry will continue to run the mines.
