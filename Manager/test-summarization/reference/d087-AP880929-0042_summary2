Florence Griffith Joyner is on target to become only the second woman to win four gold medals in track and field events in a single Olympics.
Her gold medals were in the 100 and 200 meter sprints set new Olympic and World records.
The flamboyant Griffith Joyner is confident that she can run even faster.
Her next chance to win gold would come in the 400 and 1600 meter relays.
If successful in those events, she would match the quadruple gold medal performance by American Carl Lewis in 1984 and Fanny Blankers-Koen of the Netherlands in 1948.
