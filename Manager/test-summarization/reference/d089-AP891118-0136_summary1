Marilyn Quayle, wife of the Vice President, praised the heroism of the residents of  tornado-ravaged Huntsville, Alabama, when she visited on Saturday.
She was  accompanied by the state's governor and two senators.
State and federal officials  promised to do whatever is necessary, even though national disaster funds are already  low because of the California earthquake and Hurricane Hugo.
A federal official asked  people to be patient, while the thousands of relief requests are processed.
He hopes to  have checks out in seven to 10 days.
State officials said the government could not carry  the whole burden and urged charitable contributions.
