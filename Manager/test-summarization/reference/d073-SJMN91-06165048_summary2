Three major new eruptions rocked Mt.
Pinatubo late Wednesday and early today.
Heavy  rain increased the threat of mudslides.
One eruption was so strong that it sent  seismograph needles off the chart.
Wednesday's eruptions caused U.S. officials to order further evacuations from Clark Air  Base.
Those left behind to guard the base and service sensitive communications  equipment when most left Monday were told to leave.
Philippine Civil Defense officials evacuated more than 19,000 from villages within a 12-  mile radius of Pinatubo.
Philippine President Aquino released 14.2 million dollars for  relief efforts.
