The blast with leveled a barracks at the Royal Marines Music School in Deal on Friday  was condemned as "senseless" by Prince Phillip.
The prince, husband of Queen Elizabeth  II and captain general of the Royal Marines made these remarks during a visit to the  injured men on Sunday.
Defense Secretary Tom King issued an alert to all military  installations to prevent other attacks while defending the use of private security firms at  the Music School and 29 other "low risk" military bases in Britain.
At the same time,  there were calls by the clergy for the people to help break the cycle of violence and  asking them to forgive the perpetrators.
