Two insurance companies said Tuesday that they anticipate $600 million in claims  from Hurricane Hugo which may become the most expensive ever for the industry.
Losses are particularly high due to the direct hit on Charleston and other  population centers inland.
The overall damage to insured property will  undoubtedly exceed the record $752.5 million paid after Hurricane Frederic in  1979.
No individual company is expected to go under since much of the liability  will be assumed by reinsurers.
Overall 1989 catastrophic losses for the industry  now total $1.6 billion, but these losses could be good for the industry since it  may cause companies to raise prices.
