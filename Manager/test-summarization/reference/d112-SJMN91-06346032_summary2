Economic confusion surrounds the mysterious death of publishing magnate Robert Maxwell.
Maxwell's body was found in the sea off the Canary Islands on November 5 and Spanish  authorities indicated he could have fallen into the sea after a heart attack.
Investigators say the  Maxwell siphoned money from his companies in an attempt to deal with his empire's crushing  debts.
His son Maxwell, who is the publisher of the Daily Mirror, and another son, Ian, are under  court order to tell what they know about the affairs of Bishopsgate Investment Management, Ltd,  one of the 40 companies owned by their father.
