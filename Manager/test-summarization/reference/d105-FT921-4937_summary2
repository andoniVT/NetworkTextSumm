The large majority of the authorities in Moldavia are ethnic Romanians.
The cease-fire  between them and the Russian-speaking minority was short-lived.
Most of the ethnic  Russians live east of the Dnestr River and a shooting there broke the cease-fire.
Russians  and Ukrainians account for 27 percent, and Moldavians make up 64 percent of the small  republic's population of four and a half million.
The dispute started in 1989 as a language  movement as Moldavia wanted to express their common ethnicity with Romania.
This is  a dispute that arose out of the Soviet Union's demise.
