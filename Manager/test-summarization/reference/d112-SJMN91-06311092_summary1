Robert Maxwell, the flamboyant millionaire who built a global publishing empire, was found  dead yesterday in waters off the Canary Islands where he had been vacationing on his yacht.
Maxwell, 68, who earlier this year had bought the New York Daily News, vanished overnight  from his yacht.
The Czechoslovak-born Maxwell, who escaped the Holocaust and immigrated to Britain in 1940,  personally ran his own publishing empire.
His sons Kevin and Ian took over the business  Tuesday.
His death prompted immediate concern in British financial circles about the future of  his debt-laden empire and the future of the New York Daily News.
