On Monday Clarence Thomas completed five days of questioning by the Senate  Judiciary Committees and appeared to be well on his way to confirmation.
Speculation  is that the committee will recommend confirmation by a 10-4 or 9-5 vote.
Several liberal  Democrats accused Thomas of being evasive and of disavowing controversial  statements he had made as an advocate of the Bush and Reagan administrations.
The  American Bar Association evaluation committee testified that although Thomas' articles in law journals were deficient in presentation, scholarship and analysis, this is  outweighed by his "brief but highly satisfactory performance on the Court of Appeals."
