The communist world will get its first taste of an American hamburger next week when  McDonald's opens its doors in Belgrade, Yugoslavia.
Offering Big Macs, fries and other  McDonald's specialties, some wonder if McDonald's will be as popular as the local fast- food treat, Pljeskavica.
Described as a clash between the Big Mac and the Pljeskavica,  the success of McDonald's depends on the acceptance by the Yugoslavs of the Big Mac  over the Pljeskavica.
The Pljeskavica, made of ground pork and onions, is served on  bread and sells for about a dollar.
McDonald's is scheduled to open a restaurant in  Budapest, Hungary, next year but an agreement to expand into the Soviet Union has yet  to be reached.
