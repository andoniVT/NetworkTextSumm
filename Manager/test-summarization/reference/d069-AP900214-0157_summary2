Rabbi Marvin Hier, Chairman of the Simon Wisenthal Center, has asked to meet with  West Germany's Chancellor Kolh and East Germany's Prime Minister Modrow to  discuss "the great fear that German reunification brings to the community of victims of  Nazism."
The Center, headquartered in Los Angeles, seeks to keep alive the memory of  the Nazis" persecution of Jews.
In letters to both leaders, Hier said the fears are real  because those who were scarred by the last "unified Germany" do not see their concerns  being addressed in current unification talks.
Hier listed ten points he wishes to raise  about Jewish German relationships.
