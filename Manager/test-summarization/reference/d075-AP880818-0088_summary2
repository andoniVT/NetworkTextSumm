A drug, diltiazen, used to treat patients complaining of chest pain could help prevent  heart attacks in four out five patients.
But, diltiazen increases the subsequent heart attack  in patients whose hearts pump abnormally.
Study results suggest the drug may be  effective in decreasing the likelihood of a second heart attack in the majority of patients.
But patients with pulmonary congestion given diltiazen, increase their chances of a  subsequent heart attack.
Diliazen, a calcium entry blocker, is one of a new class of drugs  in the fight against heart disease.
Nitrates and beta-blockers are the other common drugs.
