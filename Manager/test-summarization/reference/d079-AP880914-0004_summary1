Hurricane Gilbert, a category 5, one of the strongest storms in history battered the  Dominican Republic, Jamaica and the Cayman Islands.
It was the worst disaster in  Jamaica's modern history and will take some time to assess its full damage.
The storm  measured 26.13 inches of barometric pressure, the lowest ever measured in the Western  Hemisphere.
Oil companies rushed to evacuate about 10,000 oilrigs in the Caribbean.
With phones knocked out, ham radio operators in Jamaica reported that people who were  trying to enter the Wyndam Hotel on Jamaica's Montego Bay at the height of the storm  were swept into the ocean.
