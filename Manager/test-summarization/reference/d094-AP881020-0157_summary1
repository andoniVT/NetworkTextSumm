Emperor Hirohito of Japan has been bedridden for a month with an intestinal  hemorrhage.
He has received nearly 22 pints of blood since his illness worsened and the  transfusions put a strain on his heart and kidneys.
Recently his blood pressure and pulse  dipped sharply, but then returned to normal even as the internal bleeding continued.
He  is being fed intravenously and while complaining of fatigue does not appear to be in pain.
He visited with his two sons and was described as fully conscious and alert.
Princess  Michiko, Hirohito's daughter-in-law, scaled down celebrations for her 54th birthday.
