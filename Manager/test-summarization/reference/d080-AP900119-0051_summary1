The disappointment and anger following the acquittal of Raymond Buckey and his  mother Peggy McMartin Buckey on 52 charges of child molestation, is reflected in the  words "Ray must die" scrawled on the McMartin Pre-School.
Although the jury  deadlocked on the remaining 13 charges, some expressed the wish that prosecutors not  retry the Buckeys on these counts, saying it would only be the same circus.
Most parents  of children involved in the case expressed disappointment with the legal system, citing  the defense for prolonging the case and the prosecution for not doing enough research to  prosecute the case properly.
