Moslem separatists, armed with Chinese-designed AK-47 rifles, killed two Indian  paramilitary troops on Thursday as violence continues in the India state of Jammu- Kashmir.
This was the first reported slaying of paramilitary troops, but 81 people have  been killed since clashes with Moslem militants began on January 20.
The militants  reportedly exploded bombs in a bank and a government building near Srinagar, also on  Thursday.
Security was strengthened, as troops prepare for the Moslem Sabbath  tomorrow.
The governor has appealed for peace.
The separatists are seeking  independence from Hindu-majority India for the predominately Moslem state.
Kashmir  was divided between Pakistan and India in 1947.
