Iraqi's powerful army claimed victory today in its lightning invasion of oil-rich Kuwait.
The Kuwaiti emir has fled to Saudi Arabia and Iraqis occupy the palace and all  government buildings and are moving toward the oil facilities.
More that 200 Kuwaitis  were killed or wounded, including the emir's brother.
Iraq claims it invaded at the request  of revolutionaries who staged a coup and would withdraw soon.
Relations between the  two countries had been tense, before 100,000 Iraqi troops moved to the border.
The emir's  family has ruled Kuwait for almost 250 years.
Kuwait's borders and airport are closed.
