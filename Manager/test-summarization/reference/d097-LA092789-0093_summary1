State Farm Insurance Co., spokesman Jerry Parson, said the company expects  Hurricane Hugo claims as high as $400 million in South Carolina, where it insures  20% of the homes.
It is also projecting $100 million in claims from storm damage in  North Carolina and Virginia.
Nationwide Insurance Co., the biggest home and auto insurer in North Carolina and  the third largest insurer in South Carolina, expects storm claims near $100 million.
Although the losses are substantial, they are not expected to threaten the financial  health of any individual company.
Short-term earnings of some publicly traded  companies, however, might be affected.
