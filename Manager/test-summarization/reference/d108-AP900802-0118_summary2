Perspectives on the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait differ.
Iraq' deputy permanent  representative to the U.N. claims "the Iraqi government...is pursuing no goal or objective  and wishes only cordial relations with Kuwait."
He also said Iraq "will withdraw as soon  as order has been restored."
Kuwait's ambassador to the U.N. declared that the invasion  took place on a false, flimsy pretext, and if it is not "deterred in a decisive manner" by the  U.N., no country will ever be safe.
President Bush said, "We remain committed to take  whatever actions are necessary to defend our longstanding, vital interests in the Gulf."
