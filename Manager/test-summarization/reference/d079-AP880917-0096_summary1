Although Hurricane Gilbert had lost much of its muscle, it caused floods and mudslides  after it reentered Mexico on Friday.
After more than 24 hours of rain, the Santa Catarina  River overflowed its banks in Monterrey, sweeping at least 10 policemen to their deaths  and overturning buses loaded with evacuees from Matamoros.
The police officers were  on a rescue mission around midnight when they died.
The hurricane has killed more than  109 people and the death toll is expected to rise.
Although the worst appears over, in  many locations, hurricane victims are without food, drinking water, electricity, gasoline  and communications.
