Chinese troops stormed Tiananmen Square early Sunday.
The troops cut a bloody swath  through the heart of Beijing to reach the square.
Many died when troops began firing on  street people.
By 3:30 A.M. soldiers and riot police had surrounded Tiananmen, isolating  thousands of demonstrators concentrated around the Monument to Revolutionary Heroes.
Sporadic gunfire continued on the outskirts of the square, and ambulances and pedicabs  hauled away the wounded.
Troops started moving toward the monument, forcing the  students to leave and end a three-week sit-in.
