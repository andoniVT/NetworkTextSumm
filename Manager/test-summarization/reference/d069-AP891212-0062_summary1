The East German Communist Party, through its official newspaper, Neues Deutschland,  provided one of the bluntest statements to date concerning the country's troubled  situation.
It admitted that the East German socialist system had failed, and expressed  support for some type of partnership with West Germany.
Forty thousand people demonstrated for unification in Karl Marx Stadt, and in Leipzig  and Dresden shouting matches broke out between pro and anti-unification demonstrators.
The rallies came shortly after the four victorious allies of World War II met  in West Berlin to discuss the latest developments in East Germany and Berlin.
