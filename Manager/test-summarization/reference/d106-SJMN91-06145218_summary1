Nelson Mandela had presided over a divided African National Congress not yet organized for politics, in talks with the white government.
Mandela has spent his moral capital attempting to end the murderous conflict between black political factions.
Mandela's wife, Winnie, had now been convicted of a brutal criminal offense, adding to his problems.
Radical opponents in the ANC will use Winnie's conviction to arouse members against Mandela's policy of peace and negotiation.
Some optimism remains, however, since most South Africans have reacted calmly and fairly.
Those for whom Mandela and President de Klerk speak have a common interest in creating a new, non-racial country.
