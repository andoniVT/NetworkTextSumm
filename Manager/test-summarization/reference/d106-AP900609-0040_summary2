New York City mayor, Dinkins, warned Jewish groups against protesting the visit of  South African anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela, saying the visit might insult the  black community.
He also asked Jewish leaders to dissuade more radical groups from  disrupting the visit.
Jewish leaders are concerned that Mandela has embraced Yassar  Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization and has compared the  Palestinian struggle to that of black South Africans.
They want him to clarify his position  on Israel and some have said if he does not make a strong statement supporting Israel,  they would hold demonstrations.
