Chinese troops stormed Tiananmen Square early Sunday, shooting and beating their  way through crowds of pro-democracy protesters.
The assault came two weeks after  Premier Li Peng declared martial law in Beijing.
Sporadic clashes were reported on  Saturday as soldiers made several attempts to reach the square.
They retreated  temporarily under a barrage of rocks and other objects but resumed their push more  violently at about 8 p.m. firing weapons and using tear gas as they moved toward  Tiananmen.
By 3:30 a.m. Sunday troops had surrounded the square.
At 4:30 armored  personnel carriers entered the square and began slowly moving toward the several  thousand students who remained.
