It appears that Olympic gold has lost much of its commercial luster.
Following the 1984  Olympics, pixie gymnast Mary Lou Retton signed up for $5 million in commercial  advertisements.
No one from the 1988 Games will follow in her steps.
Marketers say  these medalists will pull in $100,000 to $500,000 a year.
Why?
Reasons abound.
The  games occurred halfway around the world, TV coverage was rated poor, no heroes - the  Soviets trounced U.S. competitors and drug scandals cast a pall over the Games.
Also,  many advertisers now prefer athletes who are in the public eye longer, like football  players or basketball's Michael Jordan.
