President Bush has decided to nominate James Lilley to be ambassador to China.
Lilley was CIA chief of station in China when Bush headed the US liaison office there in 1974-1975.
Lilley was born in China of American parents working there.
Bush's choice for assistant secretary of state for Latin America, Democrat Bernard Aronson, has raised concern from the two leading Republican Senators on the Foreign Relations Committee.
Senators Helms and Lugar have expressed their concerns to Secretary of State Baker.
It is unlikely that the senators will block the nomination but will probably conduct tough questioning during confirmation hearings.
