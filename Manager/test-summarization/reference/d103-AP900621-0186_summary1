The early morning earthquake which struck Iran killed at least 25,000 and injured  thousands of others as they slept on Thursday.
Scores of villages were destroyed in this  mountainous region of coastal Iran, burying the inhabitants.
The fragile homes, built on a  flood plain of loose soil, were destroyed when the soil shifted during the earthquake,  allowing the structures to collapse.
The 7.7 magnitude earthquake is the largest ever  recorded in the area where two major plates of the earth meet.
The earthquake is very  similar to one which struck Soviet Armenia on Dec. 7, 1988, and killed 25,000 people.
