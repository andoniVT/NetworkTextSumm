In the aftermath of California's earthquake, the White House flew into a whirlwind of activity  yesterday--partly to get federal aid flowing--but also to project an image of a White House in  action.
President Bush and his aides were accused of responding too slowly to the Exxon Valdez  oil tanker spill and Hurricane Hugo.
Mr. Bush was briefed early, signed a disaster proclamation, and visited the Federal Emergency  Management Agency (FEMA) where he said he hoped there would be "less carping" about the  agency's performance this time, adding that it "took a hit" for its reaction to Hurricane Hugo.
