Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, speaking at a meeting of farm magazine, extension,  advertising, co-op, and broadcasting editors, said that although the United States is  suffering from a severe drought, the U.S. will continue to be a major player in world  agriculture.
The early season drought is the worst since record keeping began in 1895.
A  large portion of the U.S. was suffering from drought stress and about 35 percent of the  contiguous United States was rated severe to extreme by July 2.
If the drought continues,  the area affected could exceed the 60 percent of 1934 and the 50 percent of 1954.
