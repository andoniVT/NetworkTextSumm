The World Jewish Congress plans to hold a conference at Wansee where the Nazi  leadership met on January 20, 1942 to implement the "final solution" of the Jewish  problem.
The meeting is scheduled for May 8th, the 45th anniversary of VE day.
It will be  the first meeting on German soil, and 100 are expected to attend.
The President of the organization says that Jews must make a moral statement on German  reunification, and Wansee is the right place to make it.
Part of the statement is that the  Holocaust must never be repeated.
