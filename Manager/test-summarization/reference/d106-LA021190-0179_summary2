World leaders welcomed South Africa's announcement of Nelson Mandela's impending  release from prison.
Britain said it is time to resume contacts with internationally  isolated South Africa, but anti-apartheid campaigners warned against any reduction of  pressure on the white-led government.
In 1986, the European Community banned many  imports from South Africa and barred new investment in the country.
British  Commonwealth leaders said that the South African government must guarantee  Mandela's safety and the Commonwealth must sustain its pressure against apartheid.
President Bush and leaders in Europe, the Soviet Union, the Middle East and Africa also  hailed the decision.
