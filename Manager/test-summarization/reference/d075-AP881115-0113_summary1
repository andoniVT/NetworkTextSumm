Phase  2 of the Thrombolysis in Miocardial Infarction Trial, or TIMI-II, has shown that  the routine practice of using balloon angioplasty is unnecessary and should be  abandoned.
The first phase of the study showed that giving tissue plasminogen activator,  or TPA,  a clot-dissolving drug, right after a heart attack dramatically improved chances  of survival.
A trial involving a group given angiolplasty and a group given TPA did not  show any difference in survival rates after a year.
This finding indicates that smaller  community hospitals can treat most heart attack patients.
Patients needing angioplasty  could be transferred to larger hospitals for treatment.
