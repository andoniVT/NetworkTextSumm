In a letter to the editor published Sunday Steve Hu wrote, "...before the war he [Hirohito]  was regarded as god and was worshipped in Japan with religious vigor.
At the surrender  of the Imperial Japanese government, Hirohito was spared punishment because it was  his ambitious military generals who made the decision to invade the neighbors.
I found it  is very hard to believe that a man in his middle age, in his position, in his culture and in  his country at that time had nothing much to do with all the military aggravations that his  armies imposed on neighboring countries."
