Hurricane Gilbert, a Category 5 storm with winds of 175 mph and the lowest barometric  pressure ever measured in the Western Hemisphere, may be the most intense hurricane  ever recorded.
Although records of geographical size are not kept, it may also be the  largest.
The other two are Hurricane Camille in 1969 that bulldozed the Mississippi coast  with a 28 foot wave, leaving 1.4 billion in damage and 256 dead, and the Labor Day  storm of 1935.
Still, the worst natural disaster in U.S. history, killing more than 6000  people, was a hurricane that hit Galveston, Texas on Sept. 8, 1900.
