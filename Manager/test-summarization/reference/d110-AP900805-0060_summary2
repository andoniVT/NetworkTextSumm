In Sunday meetings United States urged the United Nations to impose broad economic  and military sanctions on Iraq.
Western diplomats expected up to 14 votes in favor of  comprehensive sanctions, with only Cuba abstaining.
Only the five permanent members  can veto the proposal, and none is expected to do so.
The Iraqi News Service said other countries should not take "punishing action" against  Iraq, and in what sounded like a warning, said that countries should remember their  interests and citizens in Kuwait.
The Kuwait ambassador to the United Nations called the  statement "pure blackmail".
