Overcrowding and safety violations caused an aging ferry to capsize in the Ganges River.
The ferry accident was said to be India's worst ever.
The ferry was overloaded with  people and wheat and lacked life jackets.
Authorities believed at least 300 people on the  lower deck died and about 100 swam to safety.
The boat sank a short time after it sailed  about 100 yards from shore.
The boat trip is normally used by pilgrims crossing the river  to worship at a Hindu shrine.
Boat accidents are common during the monsoon season  when rivers overflow their banks.
