Planes loaded with relief supplies for Iran's earthquake victims arrived at Tehran airport from around the world.
One of the planes carried a private US relief mission, the first in more than a decade.
Delivery of the supplies from Tehran to the stricken north was hampered by aftershocks that caused landslides across some of the roads.
Dozens of nations sent people and all sorts of supplies to the devastated country.
US aid came from AmeriCares, a private relief organization, and more would come via a Red Cross charter flight carrying $225,000 worth of supplies donated by the US government.
