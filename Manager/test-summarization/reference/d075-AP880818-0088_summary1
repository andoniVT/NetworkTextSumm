Tests of Diltiazem, a calcium entry blocker, indicate that its use could prevent recurring  heart attacks in a majority of patients.
The chance of another attack decreased 80 percent  in the patients.
Significantly, however, the chance for a heart attack in patients with heart  pumping problems increased by 25 percent.
This suggests that more patients will be put  on the drug on a long-term basis.
Diltiazem is the newest in a class of drugs introduced  to fight heart disease.
Nitrates, in use for over 50 years, and beta blockers, which were  developed in the 1960s, are other treatments commonly prescribed by doctors.
