Iran said that it would welcome relief offered by its enemy, the US, to help victims of the earthquake whose numbers have now reached 35,000.
In fact, Iran has said it would welcome aid from all countries of the world except Israel and South Africa.
Aid from the US would be accepted through the Red Cross or other humanitarian organizations.
Contacts by Iran with the US are not handled directly but rather through a third party, normally the Swiss Embassy in Tehran.
Offers of assistance have come from around the world.
Shelter is needed for 400,000 left homeless by the quake.
