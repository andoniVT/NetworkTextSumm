Philippines Vice President and opposition leader Salvador H. Laurel, in Hong Kong on  Saturday, refused to condemn the armed insurrection underway in his country.
He  predicted the fighting could turn to civil war if reinforcements arrive from outer islands.
Laurel, head of the Nacionalista Party, broke with Aquino shortly after they took office  and has continued to criticize her.
He panned Aquino's request for U.S. help on Friday.
U.S. officials said jets flew over rebel aircraft to keep them on the ground, but did not  fire.
Laurel says U.S. aircraft damaged facilities and killed civilians near the armed  forces headquarters.
