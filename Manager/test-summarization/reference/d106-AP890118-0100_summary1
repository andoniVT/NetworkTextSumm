An activist and family friend of Nelson Mandela said that four African National Congress leaders that had been convicted along with Mandela in 1964 were allowed to visit Mandela just before Christmas.
The four who were all held at Victor Verster Prison were taken to Pollsmoor Prison and spent about six hours with Mandela.
The Prisons Service declined to confirm or deny the visit.
Mandela had been moved to a suburban-style home on the prison grounds in early December after recovering from tuberculosis.
Mandela's wife, Winnie, had visited him the previous month and said that he was "practically in solitary confinement".
