The Senate Armed Services Committee has put the nomination of former Texas Senator John  Tower on hold as it investigates Tower's use of alcohol and his ties to defense contractors.
This  comes amid charges that the FBI overlooked some incidents in Tower's background.
Specifically,  the FBI failed to investigate the circumstances of a blaze in Tower's hotel suite in Dallas in 1967  as well as investigating police records on several car accidents.
In one of these accidents, Tower  slightly injured the son of Senator Joe Montoya.
Tower is also accused of giving contradictory  testimony to the committee on his dealings with defense contractors.
