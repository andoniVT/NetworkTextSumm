He loves golf and played on the high school team.
In 1972 Quayle was an  aide to Indiana Gov.
Edgar Whitcomb.
Dan and wife Marilyn opened a joint law practice  in Huntington.
His favorite restaurant is Nick's Kitchen.
Quayle is known as a nice,  capable guy with good values, from a nice family that runs the local newspaper.
Quayle  didn't attend the tribute, citing a busy schedule.
