Attended by a brass band and the foreign ministers of the four World War II allies,  Checkpoint Charlie was lifted into history today.
Checkpoint Charlie was erected after  Communist East Germany built the Berlin Wall and it came to symbolize the Cold War.
Attendance by Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, the first visit of a Soviet  foreign minister to Berlin, was seen as a gesture of reconciliation.
Former West German  Chancellor Willy Brandt, who challenged the building of the wall in the 1960s as Mayor  of Berlin, sat in the front row of attendees.
Checkpoint Charlie's cobblestone foundation  disappeared to souvenir hunters after the ceremony.
