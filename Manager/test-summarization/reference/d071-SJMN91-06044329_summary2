Bill McFadden, a professional dog handler, puts in 18-hour days caring for the dogs and  crisscrossing the country to show them for a variety of owners.
He says that he and his  wife make a good living, but the overhead is high and the hours are long.
They average  100 champions a year and have shown dogs representing about 75 percent of the 135  breeds of dog.
His latest product, a Kerry blue terrier, is scheduled to appear at the  Westminister Kennel Club Dog Show at Madison Square Garden.
Apart from the  Kentucky Derby, it is the longest continuous sporting event held in the U.S.
