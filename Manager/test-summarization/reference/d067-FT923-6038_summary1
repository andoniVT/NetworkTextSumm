Hurricane Andrew yesterday smashed its way through Louisiana causing heavy  damage in rural communities but missing low-lying New Orleans.
After hitting Louisiana  with winds up to 120 miles per hour, Andrew lost force and by yesterday afternoon was  down-graded to a tropical storm.
Early reports indicate one death, 75 injuries, and  thousands homeless in Louisiana after 14 deaths in Florida and three in the Bahamas.
Across Florida 2 million people were without electricity yesterday.
There was more than  $15 billion property damage in Florida, but most of it was to uninsured property, so  insurers' losses are likely to total less than $1 billion.
