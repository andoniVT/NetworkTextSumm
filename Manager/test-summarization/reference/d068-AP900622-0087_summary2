Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze proposed today that a united Germany be  allowed to join NATO after a five-year period during which all Soviet and U.S. troops  would leave the country.
U.S. Secretary of State Baker responded, "I am  underwhelmed."
The United States objects to the 5-year waiting period while the Soviet  Union has opposed a united Germany's membership in NATO.
Shevardnadze also  remarked at a ceremony for the removal of Checkpoint Charlie that all western troops  should be removed from "greater Berlin" within six months after unification, a provision  which apparently would also apply to Soviet troops just outside the city proper.
