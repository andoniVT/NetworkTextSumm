New York City mayor Dinkins warned Jewish group not to protest the coming visit of Nelson Mandela to the city.
Jewish-American leaders plan to meet with Mandela during his visit to get clarification of his position on Israel.
Mandela had compared the struggle of Palestinians to that of black South Africans and had visited Yasser Arafat.
If Mandela does not make a strong statement in support of Israel, the Jewish leaders would take out newspaper ads and hold demonstrations.
Dinkins noted that many people hold Mandela in very high esteem and that he is "an international symbol of freedom".
