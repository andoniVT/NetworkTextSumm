The 1989 publication of the Forbes listing of the richest people again has Sam Walton as  the nation's richest man.
He has been on top since Forbes first published the listing in  1988.
This year he is in the list of the wealthiest in the world.
The annual Forbes publication makes Walton uncomfortable.
He shuns the personal  publicity that goes with his status, preferring to concentrate on Wal-Mart and pursue the  simple life on Bentonville, Arkansas.
He calls his salespeople "associates", and   frequently visits them at one of the stores.
