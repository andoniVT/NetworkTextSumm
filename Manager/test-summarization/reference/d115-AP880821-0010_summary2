An earthquake measuring 6.5 on the Richter scale struck the India-Nepal border region  Sunday, triggering landslides and destroying houses.
In India, least 100 people were  killed in Bihar and at least 1000 more injured in house collapses in Bihar and surrounding  states.
In Nepal, authorities said at least 137 were killed and more than 500 were injured.
Officials of both countries expect the death toll to rise after they receive reports from the  harder hit remote areas.
Both countries were sending emergency medical teams to the area.
Rescue operations are  being hampered by the monsoon rains which began in late June.
