Hurricane Hugo struck South Carolina Thursday after thousands of coastal  residents evacuated inland.
In Charleston Hugo littered the streets with tin  roofs, palmetto fronds and chunks of bark and by midnight 119 mph winds cracked  the roof of the 188-year-old City Hall that had withstood several earlier  hurricanes.
About 12,000 people had checked into 83 shelters across the state as  of Thursday evening.
A spokesman for the Red Cross reported that they were  providing shelter for tens of thousands of people all along the eastern seaboard  as well as for 25,000 in the Caribbean.
Hugo is expected to turn north causing  severe flooding up the East Coast.
