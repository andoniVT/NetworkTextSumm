The earthquake that struck northern Iran on Thursday killing about 25,000 people  registered 7.7 on the Richter scale.
Many of the victims lived in fragile homes built of a  ceramic-type brick or adobe that collapses easily and the quake occurred just after  midnight, so most people were inside asleep when it hit.
It occurred in an area of Iran  where most of the buildings are on a flood plain of loosely deposited soil that shifts and  allows structures to collapse.
The quake of 7.7 magnitude was the largest ever  recorded in that area where two major plates of the earth's crust meet.
