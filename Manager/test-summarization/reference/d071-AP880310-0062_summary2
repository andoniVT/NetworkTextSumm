The Dog Fancier's Club organized an event at Sardi's Restaurant in New Your City to  honor the city's top police dog and the nation's top show dog.
The top show dog is a  fluffy little Pomeranian and the police dog is an amiable German Shepherd.
The  Shepherd specializes in sniffing out bombs and narcotics.
he has helped the Police  Department make hundreds of arrests and has "apprehended" more than 50 felons.
The  Pomeranian was named best of show at the prestigious Westminister Kennel Club Show  at Madison Square Garden.
Neither dog was served lunch at the popular mid-town  restaurant.
