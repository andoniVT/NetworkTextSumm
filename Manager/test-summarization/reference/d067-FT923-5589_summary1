Both Hurricane Andrew and a dollar crisis blew themselves out this week.
Most of the  damage from the dollar crisis came a week ago Friday and the following Monday when  bond yields jumped sharply and the Dow Jones average dropped by more than 75  points.
The dollar dropped to DM 1.40, the lowest ever against the D-mark after buildup  over the summer in the difference between U. S. and German interest rates.
The effect  of Hurricane Andrew on Wall Street was not surprising.
The stocks of insurance  companies with the greatest exposure in southern Florida tumbled while those of home  construction companies showed sharp gains.
