The shuttle Discovery astronauts triumphantly launched the $1.5 billion Hubble Space  Telescope.
It happened one orbit late, after last-ditch commands from Earth freed a stuck  solar panel, averting an emergency spacewalk by crewmembers standing by to pull out  the array if necessary.
The telescope's batteries were only good for eight hours.
With the  troublesome panel unfurled, astronaut Steve Crawley used the shuttle's mechanical arm  to lift the 12.5 ton Hubble from the cargo bay.
Discovery then backed away as the  telescope, orbiting Earth every 97.3 minutes at an altitude of 380 miles, began its 15-year  search for new worlds.
