Kuwait's new Iraqi-installed government claimed that Iraqi troops began pulling out of  Kuwait on Sunday.
But White House Press Secretary, Marlin Fitzwater, said that we  have no independent confirmation of that, and furthermore, Saddam Hussein's past  actions have created serious skepticism about his intentions.
Baghdad said it replaced  Kuwait's ousted monarchy with a new government made up of nine Kuwaiti army  officers.
Kuwait's embassy in Jordan dismissed this new government as "a list of fake  names."
There was no indication that Iraqi forces had moved into Saudi Arabia, even  though they are reported to be within miles of the Saudi border.
