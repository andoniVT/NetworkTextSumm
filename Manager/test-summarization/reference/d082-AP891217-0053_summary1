Sunday was the first day of memorial ceremonies for Andrei Sakharov.
As many as  70,000 mourners viewed his body in the Youth Palace.
Sub-zero temperatures prevailed,  but the mourners waited in a line that stretched a mile from the Palace.
It was a vast  outpouring of grief for a man once ostracized and sent into exile.
It was as if the populace  was apologizing for being late in recognizing his contributions.
He will be buried on  Monday.
Yelena Bonner, his widow and fellow activist, said that she hopes his writings will finally  be made widely available in his homeland.
