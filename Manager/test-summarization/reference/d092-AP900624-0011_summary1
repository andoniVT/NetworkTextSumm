On Sunday an anti-American newspaper in Iran blamed the United States for the death  of tens of thousands of people in last week's earthquake, since it plundered Iran's oil  and other resources for 25 years preventing application of the national wealth to  development of "advanced (anti-seismic) building construction systems."
After its  expulsion from Iran, the argument continued, the U.S. imposed economic sanctions and  launched plots that halted the renovation of the country.
The paper called on Iranians to  reject relief offers by the U.S. and "other governments whose hands are stained with  the blood of the Iranian people."
Iran has said it would welcome relief from U.S.  humanitarian groups.
