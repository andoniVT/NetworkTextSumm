Hurricane Andrew hit southern Florida Monday morning, was moving north-west across  the Gulf of Mexico yesterday, and now threatens New Orleans and the coast from  Mississippi to Texas.
At least three people were killed by the storm in the Bahamas  Sunday and twelve in Florida Monday.
Two million people have been advised to move  from the threatened coastal areas.
Although it is too early to assess the cost of the  storm, one official estimates $15 billion to $20 billion of damage already.
Most of the  insurance claims from damage in Florida and Louisiana will be filed with State Farm,  Allstate, and American International Group insurance companies.
