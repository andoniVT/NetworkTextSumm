The events between Iraq and Kuwait from July 17 through August 2 resulted in war.
Saddam Hussein accused Kuwait of driving down oil prices by overproduction thereby  costing Iraq billions in lost revenues, of stealing Iraqi oil from a common field along their  border, and of conspiring with the U.S. and Israel to weaken Iraq.
Kuwait suggested that  Iraq's belligerence was to force Kuwait to forgive billions of Iraqi war debt.
Kuwait  accepted an OPEC plan to halt overproduction of oil.
Iraq then amassed troops on  Kuwait's border, pulled out of talks being held in Saudi Arabia with Kuwait to resolve  issues and attacked.
