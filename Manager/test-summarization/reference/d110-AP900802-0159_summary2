An emergency session of the foreign ministers of the Arab League was convened in Cairo  at Kuwait's request soon after Iraq's military forces overran the small Persian Gulf  nation.
Kuwait asked the League to condemn the attack.
Only Lebanon joined Kuwait in  publicly condemning the action, the first time in modern history one Arab nation has  taken over the government of another.
Kuwait invoked the 1950 Joint Defense Pact that  calls on League members to come to the aid of any member that is a victim of military  action.
The first session adjourned without taking any action.
