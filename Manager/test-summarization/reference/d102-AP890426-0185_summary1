Lucille Ball, the pioneering queen of television comedy, died Wednesday at 77 of a  ruptured abdominal artery.
She had been recovering steadily from heart surgery at  Cedars-Sinai Medical Center when the aorta burst, sending her into cardiac arrest.
Accolades immediately poured in from friends, former co-workers, and Presidents.
She  and her first husband, Desi Arnaz, produced and co-starred on the precedence setting "I  Love Lucy", one of the most popular TV shows ever.
She was born in New York,  became a model, then appeared in 75 plus movies.
In recent years her career slowed and  she last performed at the March Academy Awards.
