The Barcelona Olympic men's marathon will prove one of the demanding ever run.
The  marathon will be run in the heat and humidity of late afternoon and most of the last 10  kilometers is uphill.
Runners in the women's marathon, who followed the same course  the men will use, showed great physical and mental distress.
The winner of the women's  marathon had a time of 2 hours and 32 minutes, considerable slower than in Los Angeles  and Seoul.
The marathon was scheduled in late afternoon so it could be covered in prime  TV viewing time.
