On Thursday the government allowed people to the edge of Tiananmen Square.
They got  their first glance at the 100-acre expanse since troops swept in and crushed the movement  for democratic reform.
For seven weeks the square had been the focal point of the  movement.
Chinese Red Cross officials estimate that 3,600 died and 60,000 were injured  in and around the square last weekend.
The "Goddess of Democracy", a student-built replica of the Statue of Liberty was  crushed by a tank last Sunday.
The Monument to Revolutionary Heroes, where the  protesters made their last stand, has been swept clean.
