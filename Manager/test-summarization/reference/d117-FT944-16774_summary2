After hours of deliberation last night, the #20,000 Booker Prize for fiction, as it always has in its  26-year history, provoked controversy when it went to James Kelman for "How Late It Was,  How Late", the story of a Scottish lowlife narrated in Glaswegian dialect.
Bookseller dismissed  the whole shortlist as narcoleptic.
The chairman of the Booker judges acknowledged heated deliberation.
He said the book might  be deemed inaccessible and went on record with a rousing condemnation of contemporary  fiction.
Another judge was attacked for failing to reveal a novelist being considered for the award  was, in fact, his wife.
