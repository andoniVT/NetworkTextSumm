Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin, meeting for the first time since the coup collapsed,  pressed ahead with a sweeping purge of coup supporters.
Gorbachev said at the Russian  Parliament that the government would prosecute those responsible for the takeover.
He accused  the Communist Party Central Committee of panicking during the coup, and threw out his foreign  minister.
Yeltsin, who led the nationwide coup resistance, suspended six Communist Party newspapers  and nationalized printing presses in the Russian Republic.
The Communist Party was banned  from the KGB.
Gorbachev said he would meet with the leaders of the nine republics supporting the Union  Treaty.
