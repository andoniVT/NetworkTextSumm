With unchecked carbon dioxide and methane gas emissions, world temperatures could  rise 10 degrees and the greenhouse effect could breed hurricanes 50% stronger than  Hugo, which blasted the Caribbean and Carolinas last week with 135mph winds.
Last  year's Gilbert, with winds reaching 180mph, is the most powerful hurricane recorded and  seems the upper limit with current ocean temperatures.
But if seas warm up 3-6 degrees,  winds could be 25% higher with 50% more destructive force.
Hugo demonstrated the  effect of warm water when its winds jumped from 105 to 135mph as it passed over the  Gulf Stream.
The hurricane intensity scale may have to be raised to 6.
