The Seoul, Korea 1988 Summer Olympics closed on Sunday.
9,633 athletes from 160  nations competed in 34 venues.
At least 1 billion people watched via a 115-nation  worldwide TV hookup.
It was the first meeting between the Soviet Union and the United  States since 1976.
The Soviets captured the most medals, the U.S. third most.
Among  the U.S. highlights were championships won by Greg Louganis, Florence Griffith Joyner,  Jackie Joyner-Kersee and Matt Biondi.
A big Olympic negative was the stripping of the  gold medal from Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson because of drug use.
He flew home in  disgrace.
