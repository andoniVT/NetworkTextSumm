The United Nations Security Council today voted 14-0 to condemn Iraq's pre-dawn  invasion of Kuwait.
Only Yemen abstained.
The vote came in an emergency session  requested by United States and Kuwait.
United States reiterated its support of Kuwait.
The Security Council said it supports all Iraq and Kuwait negotiations, and specifically  endorsed mediation efforts by the Arab League that  Iraq claims the invasion was a move to come to the aid of revolutionaries in Kuwait.
That  was dismissed by Kuwait as a pretext for a completely unprovoked attack.
