Greek divers located the remains of a wooden sailing vessel on 3 May 1988.
The vessel  was found near Chios, a Greek island in the eastern Aegean Sea, where a Greek naval  vessel sank a Turkish warship on 7 June 1882.
The Turkish vessel was identified as the Bourloti Seimaz, or translated as "Explosives  Invincible".
It was returning from raiding and killing thousands of Greeks on Chios.
More than 1,000, including 400 Greeks, were aboard the Turkish ship.
The ship was  crammed with loot taken from Chios.
The Greek divers hope to interest American and Turkish experts to help in recovering the vessel.
