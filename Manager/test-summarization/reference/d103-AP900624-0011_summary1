An editorial in the anti-American newspaper Johamri Islami in Iran stated that the united  States is partly to blame for the thousands of deaths in last week's earthquake.
Saying  that even the people buried in the rubble chant "Death to Americans," the newspaper  accused the U.S. of plundering Iran's resources.
In doing so, the United States diverted  Iran's national wealth from urban development projects and the construction of  earthquake resistant buildings.
The newspaper called on the U.S. to stop hatching plots  and called on a rejection of aid from the U.S. Iran has said it welcomes relief from the  American Red Cross and other humanitarian groups.
