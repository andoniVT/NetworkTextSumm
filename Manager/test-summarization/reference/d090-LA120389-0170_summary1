Saturday Philippine Vice President and opposition leader Salvador Laurel refused to  condemn the armed insurrection in his country and predicted the fighting may become  civil war if rebel reinforcements arrive from other islands.
Laurel broke with Aquino shortly after they took office in 1986.
As head of the  opposition Nacionalista Party, he has criticized Aquino frequently.
Laurel criticized Aquino for asking for U.S. military assistance.
Friday, U.S. officials said  Phantom jets patrolled rebel aircraft to keep them grounded but did not fire.
Laurel  claims the U.S. aircraft destroyed Philippine air force facilities near Sangley Point and  killed civilians near Camp Aquinaldo.
