The Air Force said Saturday that 12 of the 47 sailors killed in an explosion of the No.
2  gun turret on the USS Iowa Wednesday have been autopsied.
It will take up to 10 days to  complete the exams of the remaining 35 sailors.
No cause of death was announced for  any sailors.
Meanwhile, the Wisconsin, sister ship to the Iowa, was opened in Norfolk and sailors  talked about their pride in battleships and sense of loss.
The Iowa will arrive at its home, Norfolk Naval Base, this afternoon.
Six investigators  are aboard searching for clues to the blast.
