A day after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait a Central Intelligence Agency spokesperson said  that the invasion came as no surprise.
The Agency delivered useful and timely  information to policy makers.
Administration and congressional officials agreed that they  had received warning from that CIA that Iraq was in a position to attack and might do so  art any time.
The Agency lacked hard evidence of intent of Iraq's intent, but as the  buildup grew, they became more alarmed, partly because Saddam Hussein is  unpredictable, and also because, like many other Arab leaders, he has been known to  carry through on his threats.
