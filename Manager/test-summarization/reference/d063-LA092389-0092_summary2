In what they said was a response to Prime Minister Thatcher's "declaration of war" in a  speech to the Ulster Defense Force, the Irish Republican Army claimed responsibility for  an explosion which leveled a three-story barracks in Deal, killing 10 and injuring 22.
The  barracks, which belonged to the Royal Marines Music School, was the latest in a series of  IRA bombings of military facilities.
Security forces believe at least two IRA "active  service units" are operating in Britain and Europe.
Two members of these groups, Patrick  Sheehy, known as the Jackal, and John Conaghty are being sought in connection with  earlier attacks.
