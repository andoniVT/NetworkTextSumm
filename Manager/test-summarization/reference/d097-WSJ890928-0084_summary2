Damage from Hurricane Hugo which hit the Carolinas and Caribbean last week will  reduce third-quarter earnings for several insurers.
American International Group expect  a reduction in pretax earnings of $35-45 million with reinsurance covering most  damages above $35 million.
St. Paul estimates the pretax cost of Hugo as less than  $50 million after its reinsurance contracts are figured in and Cigna is estimated to have  a 35-45% reduction in after-tax per share earnings.
State Farm expects its total claims  for Hugo to reach $500 million which is more than three times the record $165 million  for Hurricane Alicia in 1983.
