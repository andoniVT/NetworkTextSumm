Thousands of Moslems gathered for the funeral of Ashfaq Mmajid Wani, a leader of the Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front separatist group.
Police shot him after he tried to hurl a grenade into a police bunker while riding by on a motor scooter.
The thousands of residents had gathered near Wani's home in an attempt to hold funeral procession in defiance of a government curfew.
Soldiers and police prevented the procession and took Wani's body to a burial ground in a government ambulance.
At least 233 have now been killed since January 20th when police launched a crackdown on violence by Moslem separatists.
