Strikes by thousands of miners spread from the Siberian region to Vorkuta in the far north,  Rostov in southwestern Russia, Dnepropetrovsk in the Ukraine and Karaganda in Soviet Central  Asia.
The miners are seeking greater local control over their industries and better wages and  living conditions.
The strikes are the country's worse since the 1920s.
The government has acknowledged that conditions for the miners are abysmal and has made  general pledges of improvement.
President Gorbachev said the strikes could imperil his reforms.
He said we may have to take such extreme measures that it will hurt what we've been doing.
