The earthquake, which devastated Iran killed at least 25,000 people and injured thousands more.
Most of the victims were asleep when the quake struck and died when their fragile homes collapsed on them.
The quake registered a magnitude 7.7 which is considered a major quake and is the largest ever recorded in Iran, although twelve quakes greater than magnitude 7 have occurred there in the past 30 years.
Most of the homes were built on a flood plain of loosely deposited soil that shifts in an earthquake and allows buildings to collapse.
A US Geological Survey geophysicist compared the quake to Armenian quake two years earlier.
