In trying to brush aside recent differences with London, U.S. President Bill Clinton  stressed Washington's special relationship with Britain.
These remarks came as Clinton  welcomed Prime Minister John Major in Pittsburgh where Major's grandfather and father  once lived.
Following the visit to Pittsburgh, Clinton and Major will return to the White  House, where Major will spend the night, the first foreign head of state to do so since  Clinton became president.
High on the agenda for talks between the two men are the  tragedy in Bosnia as well as Russia, Northern Ireland, and world trade.
Clinton and Major  will meet in June again during D-Day commemoration ceremonies.
