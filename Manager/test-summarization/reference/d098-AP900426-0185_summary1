Six hours after a failed attempt, ground controllers re-established contact Thursday with  the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) through its main antennas.
Controllers sent  positional information to the telescope and widened the radio beam to cover a larger  area around the two high-speed  antennas.
Space shuttle Discovery trailed 57 miles  behind the HST and was to stay nearby until the Hubble's aperture door is opened  Friday morning.
If signals fail to open the  door, astronauts will walk into space and  crank it open Saturday.
The shuttle, scheduled to return to earth on Sunday, would  extend its mission if the space walk is necessary.
