Bob Dole nominated Dan Quayle, the junior senator from Indiana, for vice president at  the Republican National Convention in August.
Dole called him one of the bright young  lights in the Republican Party, a dedicated public servant, a forceful advocate, a staunch  supporter of the Reagan revolution, and a devoted family man.
Dole said he knew and  trusted Quayle.
Whenever needed, Quayle was ready to make tough choices and cast  tough votes.
Quayle spent 12 years as a congressman and senator, tackling the vital  national and international issues that affect the lives Americans and the future of our  country.
