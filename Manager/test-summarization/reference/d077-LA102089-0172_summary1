In the recent San Francisco earthquake, why did some luxury four-story apartments or office  buildings collapse while high-rises escaped virtually unscathed?
Accordingly, some buildings  collapsed because of two things: very poor soil and very poor structural design.
Some were built  over landfill and others were erected earlier when there were no earthquake codes.
Four-story buildings with garages underneath have no walls on one side.
Connections break and  the front falls.
Skyscrapers usually survive because architects factor in wind gusts and earth  movement.
In smaller buildings, contractors make sure that vertical forces--such as snow and  ice--cannot force a collapse.
