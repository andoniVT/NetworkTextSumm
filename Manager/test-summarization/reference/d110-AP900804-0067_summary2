Saudi Arabia's reaction to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait has been subdued.
The presence  of Iraqi forces near the border concerns the Saudis who do not want to provoke Iraq into  attacking Saudi oilfields only 150 miles south of the border.
Oil executives cite this as  reason for believing Saudi Arabia will not close the pipeline that carries exported Iraqi oil  across Saudi Arabia.
Saudi Arabia did join the other five members of the Gulf Cooperation Council in low-key  condemnation of the invasion.
The Council maintains a military force of only 3,000 that  is no match for Iraq.
