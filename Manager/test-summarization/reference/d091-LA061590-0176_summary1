A flash flood raged through small town areas along the Ohio River in eastern Ohio.
So far, at least ten people are known dead but dozens are missing.
The flood created a wall of water 15 to 20 feet high as it tore through the area.
The flood struck near the village of Shadyside, Ohio.
The village is about ten miles south of Wheeling, West Virginia.
A crowded bar in Shadyside was washed away when the torrent of water caved in a wall.
Only two people have been accounted for.
Ohio Governor Celeste declared a state of emergency after surveying the area.
