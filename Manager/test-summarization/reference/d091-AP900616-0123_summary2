Kerri Trigg who was playing in a friend's house when it was washed away in a flash  flood that swept through Shadyside Thursday night is one of nearly three dozen still  missing two days later.
Searchers for the missing used dogs to sniff through the rubble  and for five miles south of town along the banks of the Wegee and Pipe creeks.
Workers  also searched the debris around the Hannibal locks and dam, 25 miles south of town.
Kerri's friend, Amber Colvin, was swept down Wegee Creek and into the Ohio River, but  survived a seven-mile ordeal by clinging to logs.
