President Aquino used small bombers and artillery to end a rebellion led by renegade  army Col. Alexander Noble on Mindanao, countering charges that her government is  indecisive.
The Oct. 4-6 uprising never spread to the military underground on other  islands.
Aquino has survived two major coup attempts and several aborted military mutinies.
Most ended in standoffs or dragged on for days because military leaders were reluctant to  order troops to fire on other soldiers.
Noble's rebellion coincided with the release of a government report that concluded coup  attempts will probably continue -- but unlikely to succeed -- for the indefinite future.
