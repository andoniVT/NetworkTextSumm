Astronomers were jubilant as the space shuttle Discovery lifted off carrying the Hubble  Space Telescope into orbit, putting an end to seven years of delays caused by  technical problems and the Challenger explosion.
Charles O'Dell who has worked 19  years on Hubble declared, "There is nothing better than to see 19 years of my work and  five of my friends thrust into orbit."
Physics and astronomy professor Colin Norman  called the launch "the perfect start to a great adventure for mankind."
William Jeffreys,  Hubble's astrometry project leader proclaimed, "This is one of those times when we are  thrilled beyond belief."
