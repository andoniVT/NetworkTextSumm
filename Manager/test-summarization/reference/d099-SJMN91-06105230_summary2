The Boston Marathon is becoming a reckless speed duel and the last three have produced  five of the top 10 times in the race's history.
They also have resulted in a race of  attrition, with many of the early speedsters faltering in the late stages.
Last year's  winner, Gelindo Bordin, ran a patient, calculating race, passing thee race leaders at the 21  mile mark and winning in 2 hours, 8 minutes, 19 seconds, the second fastest time in the  race's history.
Foremost among the women entrants is Ingrid Kristiansen, who holds    the world record of 2:21:06 and who won in Boston in 1986 and 1989.
