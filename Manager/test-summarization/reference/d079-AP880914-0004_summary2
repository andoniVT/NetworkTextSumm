Hurricane Gilbert, one of the strongest storms in history roared, toward Mexico's  Yucatan Peninsula Tuesday.
It has already battered the Dominican Republic, Jamaica,  and the Cayman Islands.
Jamaica was hardest hit with six people killed and 60,000 left  homeless.
Communications are down and the airports are closed.
Gilbert has been  upgraded to a Category 5, the strongest, with winds greater than 155 mph.
