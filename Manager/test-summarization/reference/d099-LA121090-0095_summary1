The 1990 San Diego Marathon was run on the North County course.
It was the first  marathon to be run there.
Contestants liked the new course.
The marathon was run in  beautiful weather, with warm breezes and 74-degree readings.
Over 4,000 runners participated, but the field was considered to be a weak one.
Benjamin  Martinez of Mexico was the men's winner.
Kathy Smith of Newport Beach was the  fastest woman.
Each received two thousand dollars for the victory.
Both are relatively  new to running the marathon distance of 26.2 miles, and for each it was the first marathon  victory.
