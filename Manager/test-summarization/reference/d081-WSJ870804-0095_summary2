An estimated 200,000 black gold and coal miners in South Africa are expected to begin a strike  for higher wages and better working conditions.
It would be the largest job action ever to affect  the mining industry in that nation.
If other mines join in, a total of 300,000 miners could be on  strike.
Gold and coal account for more than half of South Africa's foreign-currency holdings.
The union is demanding a 30% across-the-board wage increase for black miners who it says earn  an average of $109 a month.
The Chamber of Mines says they earn twice that much.
