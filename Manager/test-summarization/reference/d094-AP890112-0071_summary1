A British Broadcasting documentary claims that U.S. prosecutors pressured Japan's  wartime prime minister into changing testimony at his trial to avoid incriminating  Emperor Hirohito in war crimes.
General MacArthur feared that if Hirohito were  indicted, it would touch off a guerrilla war and the documentary claims the decision not  to prosecute was Truman's.
The documentary challenges Hirohito's image as a peaceful  man, saying he must have know about the massacre of Chinese at Nanking and knew  more than a month in advance of Japan's plan to attack Pearl Harbor.
Hirohito died in  1989 at the age of 87.
