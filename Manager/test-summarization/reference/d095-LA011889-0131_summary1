Patrick Edward Purdy was a student at Cleveland Elementary School from kindergarten  through the third grade.
Although over 600 of the 980 students are Asian, authorities are  not certain that race was a motive.
Police are still investigating what caused Purdy to  open fire at the school with an AK-47, killing five students and injuring 29 more.
His  grandmother was at a loss to explain his behavior and an aunt described him as a loner  and a child alcoholic.
Only about 200 students returned to Cleveland Elementary today.
Counselors were there to help the children and each child received a stuffed animal.
