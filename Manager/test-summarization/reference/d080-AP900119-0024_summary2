A therapist defended her role in the McMartin Pre-School molestation trial against  Raymond Buckey and his mother, which ended Thursday with acquittal on 52 counts and  13 counts deadlocked.
Jurors had criticized the techniques she used in videotaped  interviews of McMartin students, claiming she asked leading questions.
The therapist,  Kee McFarlane, says the techniques are sound and children must be helped to overcome  their fears.
She also said she still believes the children had been molested and the  outcome was tragic.
She suggested that therapy goals are not consistent with legal  standards required for a successful prosecution.
