John Onoda, a spokesman at McDonald's Oak Brook, Ill., headquarters said the first of  the chain's outlets in a communist country will open on March 24th.
The success of the  American restaurant will depend on its acceptance by Yugoslavians who are long  accustomed to eating the hamburger like pljeskavica which is made of pork and onions,  served on bread and eaten with the hands, much like a hamburger.
The next scheduled  opening in a communist country will occur by the end of the year in Budapest, Hungary.
McDonald's negotiations with the Soviet Union over many years have not been fruitful.
