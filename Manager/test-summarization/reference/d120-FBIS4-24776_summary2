The Conservatives are moving to replace party leader John Major and remove him as  prime minister.
In local elections across Britain yesterday, the Conservatives suffered  their worst defeat ever.
The defeat put them in third place behind the Liberal Democrats  and the Labor Party.
This came as former Conservative members of Parliament  announced that they would vote for the Liberal Democrats.
Major is seen is indecisive  and weak in his handling of foreign and domestic affairs.
While calling for a return to  basic values, his own cabinet has been rocked by scandal.
Major has also reneged on  campaign promises not to increase taxes.
