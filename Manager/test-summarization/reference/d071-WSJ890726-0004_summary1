One of the three owners of Cory, a champion German short-haired pointer is suing the  other two for damages and to determine if Cory is officially retired.
Cory has won 245  shows as Best-of-Breed and 19 awards as Best-in-Show.
Plaintiff Attalla claims the  owners' agreement specifies that he advances fees to show the dog and he decides when  Cory retires.
He is suing the other two owners, John and Rita Remondi for $125,000 in  fees and to stop them from showing Cory, who has been officially retired as announced in  Dog News.
The Remondis claim that Cory's retirement is fraudulent.
