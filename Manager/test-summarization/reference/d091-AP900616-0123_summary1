The mother of a 12-year-old girl held out hope for her daughter who, along with nearly three dozen others, was still missing two days after the floods in eastern Ohio.
The girl was with a nine-year-old friend, Amber Colvin, when the flood struck.
Amber was swept down Wegee Creek and into the Ohio River, but survived a seven-mile ordeal by clinging to logs.
Searchers used trained dogs to search rubble along creek banks and workers sifted through debris collected at the Hannibal locks and dam 25 downstream on the Ohio River.
Victims told stories of fear, luck, and close calls during the flood.
