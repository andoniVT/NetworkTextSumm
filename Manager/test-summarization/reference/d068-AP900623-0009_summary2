On Friday a crane lifted Checkpoint Charlie, the Allied border crossing on the west side  of the Berlin Wall, and placed it on a flatbed truck.
The guardhouse was taken away in  an elaborate ceremony attended by six foreign ministers,  a brass band and hundreds  of reporters.
The public was not invited to the ceremony but many Berliners viewed it  from nearby, reliving memories of attempted escapes through the checkpoint that went  up with the Berlin Wall in 1961.
Now with the wall being dismantled daily in anticipation  of German unification, U.S. officials decided to remove Checkpoint Charlie with a grand  flourish.
