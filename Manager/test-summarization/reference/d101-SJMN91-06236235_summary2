Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin, appearing to act as equals, launched a sweeping purge of  the Communist Party today.
Gorbachev fired his foreign minister and named a new head of the  KGB.
Yeltsin fired the heads of state-owned media.
All of Moscow's Communist Party  buildings were sealed as protesters blockaded the Party headquarters to prevent removal of  document linking Party members with the coup.
Gorbachev affirmed Yeltsin's decrees to ban party activities in the Russian republic, the police  and KGB, but balked at proposals to ban the Communist Party.
It wasn't clear whether  Gorbachev had intended to back Yeltsin's decrees.
