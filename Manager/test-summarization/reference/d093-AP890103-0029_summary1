Authorities charges a ferry captain with negligent homicide after the boat, overcrowded  with New Year's travelers sank off Guatemala' east coast.
Sixty-seven people drowned,  14 were missing and 46 survived.
The ferry ran out of fuel mid-way in its journey and  sank after a naval patrol boat tried to tow it to port.
The ferry captain was slow to  respond to requests by the skipper of the naval patrol boat to take control of the ferry's  wheel once it was under tow.
The ferry captain radioed that he had taken the wheel just  as the boat began to capsize.
