Marilyn Quayle, wife of Vice President Dan Quayle, visited the severely tornado-damaged city  of Huntsville, AL.
She praised workers, the heroes, and the corporations that have made  donations to aid recovery.
Federal and state officials have pledged to do whatever is necessary to  help but Hurricane Hugo and the San Francisco quake have squeezed relief funds.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has allocated $1.1 billion of its  authorized $1.3 billion supplemental funding for the hurricane damage and $1.2 billion for  California's earthquake disaster.
Alabama will pay 25% of the relief costs but is urging  donations to relief agencies.
