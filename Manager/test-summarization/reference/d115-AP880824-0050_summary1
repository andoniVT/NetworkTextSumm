Nepalese police have bulldozed more than 50 brick and mud houses that have been made  unstable by an earthquake that struck near the India-Nepal border and killed at least 749  people.
Police said they will continue demolishing houses until satisfied that those  remaining are safe to live in.
Most homeless have moved in with neighbors or found  shelter in tents while waiting to hear from the government about compensation or new  homes.
Prime Minister Shrestha while visiting Nepal's hardest hit town, Dharan, on  Tuesday said, "This is the biggest calamity to strike Nepal."
The quake registered 6.5 on  the Richter scale.
