The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) accuses the Bombay stock  exchange of flouting regulations including those designed to limit excessive speculative  investments.
The exchange denies the allegations, but the dispute does nothing to  stimulate the stock market where shares have fallen 48 per cent from their peak early  last year.
This week's argument is only the latest in a series of disputes which date from  SEBI's creation a year ago.
Brokers claim the SEBI fails to understand their needs.
The  finance minister is backing SEBI to the hilt and singled it out for praise in his recent  budget message.
