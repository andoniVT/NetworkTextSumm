The nature of this week's California earthquake is described by some of those on the  scene.
One reported from the World Series at Candlestick Park that the upper deck  was shaking and the light stanchions were swaying.
A driver approaching San  Francisco thought she had hit fog.
"Then I could see a big ball of flame."
Another found  assessing the damage from the quake is "like the blind man trying to feel an elephant."
A school teacher commented, "It was like somebody slugging a punching bag...this  one went on and on...it just wouldn't stop...it was very very bad."
