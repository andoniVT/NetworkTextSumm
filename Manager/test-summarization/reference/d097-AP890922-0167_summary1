National Hurricane Center forecasters used computer models to track Hugo's path  into Charleston, giving people time to evacuate the South Carolina coast.
A greater  problem was predicting the intensity of the storm, which was upgraded to a  Category 4 hurricane just hours before it hit Charleston.
The increase in wind  speed, which was detected by Air Force reconnaissance, surprised hurricane  specialists.
Satellite information is fed to supercomputers at the National Meteorological Center  in Suitland, Md.
which send data to the hurricane center's tracking model.
MIT  meteorology professor Kerry Emmanuel criticizes the system because satellites  don't provide sufficient wind and temperature data.
