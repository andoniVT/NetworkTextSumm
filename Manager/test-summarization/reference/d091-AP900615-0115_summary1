Thunderstorms swept through eastern Ohio causing flooding that killed at least ten people, left many missing, and drove hundreds from their home.
Ohio Governor Celeste declared a state of emergence and surveyed the area.
Temporary morgues were set up at the Bellaire City Hospital and at a funeral home in Shadyside, a community of 4,300 about ten miles south of Wheeling, West Virginia.
Two creeks in this area that empty into the Ohio River were the main area where flooding occurred.
The Ohio Emergency Management Agency was assisted in coping with the emergency by other state agencies and the Red Cross.
