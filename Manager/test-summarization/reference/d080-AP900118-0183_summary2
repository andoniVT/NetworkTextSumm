Thursday's acquittals in the McMartin Pre-School molestation case brought widely  divergent reactions.
The defendants wept with relief.
Parents of former students decried  the system for failing their children.
Special targets of criticism were the personal  ambitions of the prosecutors and the decision to have a private child-therapy group  interview potential victims.
Jurors said they were not convinced beyond a reasonable  doubt and never got the children's stories in their own words.
The case was the longest  and most costly in American judicial history.
The lurid story at times included  allegations of hundreds of molestations by seven individuals, underground tunnels, and  Satanic rituals.
