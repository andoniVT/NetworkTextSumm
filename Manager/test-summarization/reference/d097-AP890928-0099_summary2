Hurricane Hugo did not simply wreak devastation on the Carolinas; it brought about  repayment of a long overdue debt.
Kingston, N.Y., the capital of New York in 1777, was  burned by the British in October of that year.
New York Gov.
George Clinton received  from South Carolina Gov.
Abraham Livingston a letter dated March 31, 1778 enclosing  1,000 New York pounds  "...for the charitable purpose of alleviating the distresses of the  now-indigent inhabitants of the town of Kingston...".
A local historian remembered the  letter and now Kingston is raising money to help Charleston, S.C. recover from the  ravages of Hugo.
