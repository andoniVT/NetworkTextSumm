In Kuwait, with the sound of gunfire, artillery and military jets streaming overhead, the  entire foreign community is staying indoors.
The crisis began on July 17 when Saddam  accused the Kuwaitis of trying to wreck his debt-ridden economy with oil overproduction  and of stealing Iraqi oil from a border oil field.
He also demanded that Kuwait turn over  the Gulf island of Bubiyan and forgive multi-billion dollar loans incurred by Iraq during  its 1980-1988 war with Iran.
The invasion came a day after talks between Iraq and  Kuwait collapsed.
Today's fighting sent oil prices surging in international markets.
