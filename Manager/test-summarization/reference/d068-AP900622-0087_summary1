Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Schevardnadze outlined the Soviet proposal allowing a  united Germany to join NATO after a five-year transition period.
The proposal came  during international talks in East Berlin on the strategic future of a united Germany.
The  U.S. and its NATO allies object to the proposal.
The proposal also called for the  departure of Western troops from West Berlin within six months as well as a 50 percent  reduction of the troops of all fours nations in the country within five years, eventually  reducing them further to a level of token contingents or completely withdrawing from  Germany.
