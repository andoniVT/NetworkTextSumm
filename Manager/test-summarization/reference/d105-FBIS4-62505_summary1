The Tajik Communist Party has called for the restoration of a renovated Soviet Union in the form of a federation as the only means to ensure the development of the political, economic and spiritual potential of the former Soviet republics.
They claim that the disintegration of the Soviet Union and the parade of sovereignty that followed have led to economic and political chaos.
Tajikistan was very hard hit by the wave of ethnic conflict and general unrest that occurred when the Soviet Union collapsed.
The civil war in the republic claimed over 100,000 lives.
The Party says the majority of Tajiks support such a restoration.
