As vice president, Dan Quayle is likely to be the "man on the outside" in the Bush White House.
His image is that of political novice and during the campaign he was relegated to small towns and safe GOP areas.
Bush rarely mentioned him while campaigning.
Quayle has said that he will be a close advisor to Bush but few believe that will happen.
Bush and Walter Mondale in their VP campaigns had placed key staffers in their respective presidential campaigns.
Quayle has contributed nothing in the way of staff to Bush's campaign.
Quayle is apparently adapting to his anticipated role and anonymity.
