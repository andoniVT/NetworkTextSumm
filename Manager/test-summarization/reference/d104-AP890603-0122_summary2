On Saturday at 1 a.m. tens of thousands of troops entered Beijing from the east  marching toward Tiananmen Square.
Blocked east of the square by thousands of  people, the troops dispersed, walking around near the square in small groups.
About  noon two truckloads of People's Armed Police attacked crowds east of the square.
Later about 5,000 troops appeared firing tear gas and clubbing protesters west of the  square.
Skirmishes continued until 9 p.m. when troops started firing at the rock-throwing  protesters.
Shooting continued through the night until 5 a.m. Sunday morning when the  demonstrators,  surrounded by armed and firing troops, began leaving the square,  ending their three-week occupation.
