A study published today in the New England Journal of Medicine indicates that an  intestinal operation to lower cholesterol of heart attack patients reduced the risk of a  second heart attack.
Called a partial ileal bypass, changes the route of the small intestine  so that one-third of it is bypassed.
Although lowering the risk of a second heart attack, a  major drawback of the procedure is chronic diarrhea, which can last for years.
Patients  also are more prone to kidney stones, gallstones, and intestinal obstructions.
Patients with  severe heart damage were not helped by the procedure.
