On Wednesday, Hurricane Gilbert, a category 5 storm, the strongest and deadliest type,  slammed into the Yucatan Peninsula with 160mph winds causing heavy damage to the  resort areas of Cancun and Cozumel.
More than 120,000 people on the northeast  Yucatan coast were evacuated.
Earlier the storm killed 19 people in Jamaica and 5 in the  Dominican Republic.
It destroyed and estimated 100,000 of Jamaica's 500,000 homes.
Mexican officials were often helpless as floods closed roads and downed power lines  disrupted phone service.
The already record-setting storm is expected to intensify as it  leaves the Yucatan and again moves over water.
