Since East Germans began agitating for an end to Communist domination two months  ago, public pressure has forced the opening of the Berlin Wall and garnered the promise  of free elections.
However, the issue of reunification could fracture the popular East  German movement.
Although the Communists admit that East Germany's socialist  system has failed, many East German's are seeking a new "democratic socialism" within  a multi-party system.
They favor a type of partnership with West Germany rather than  reunification.
Pro and anti reunification rallies came shortly after the four victorious  World War II Allies met to discuss the latest East German developments.
