Australian novelist Peter Carey was awarded the Booker Prize for fiction Tuesday for his mid- 19th century Australian love story, "Oscar and Lucinda".
A panel of five judges, who  unanimously announced the award of the $26,250 prize, made their selection from 102 books  published in Britain in the last 12 months and which they read in their homes.
Carey was the  only non-Briton among the exceptionally strong competitors in the final six.
Book Trust, an educational charity promoting books, administers the Booker Prize that was first  awarded in 1969.
It is sponsored by Booker, an international food and farming business.
