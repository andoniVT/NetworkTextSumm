The Academy Awards are criticized for their unfairness when films get nominated but  their directors don't, perhaps out of professional jealousy.
For instance, director Steven  Spielberg has never been nominated for an individual achievement even though his films  are the biggest moneymakers in history.
The Irving Thalberg award for consistently high  quality of production has come in handy for acknowledging giants who were overlooked  and for salving the academy's conscience.
Spielberg received the Thalberg award in  1987.
In 1986 the Directors Guild named him best director.
Films that became classics  have been overlooked, too.
"Citizen Kane" won only for its script.
