Bill McFadden, a 32-year-old professional dog handler, knows that the secret to  producing champions is just plain, hard work.
Bill, assisted by his wife Taffe, puts in 18  hour days grooming and conditioning his charges, and then crisscrosses the country  showing them for their owners.
McFadden handles an average of 20 to 25 dogs at each  show and works around 120 shows a year throughout the U.S.  "We finish with close to  100 champions a year," he said.
McFadden's latest product, a Kerry blue terrier named  Kerrageen's Hotspur with 37 Best in Show wins, is the top in his breed of all time.
