With the Hubble Space Telescope about to be launched, astronomers are again excited  about what it might accomplish.
It will scan the outermost reaches of space for clues  about the origin and possible end of the universe.
Its launch has been delayed since 1983  by technical problems and the Challenger accident.
At an altitude of 380 miles, it will  orbit far above earth's distorting atmosphere.
During its 15-year working lifetime, the  telescope will provide astronomers with 10 times better resolution and 25 times more  sensitivity than ground-based observatories.
Its use, shared with the European Space  Agency, will cost about $200 million per year.
