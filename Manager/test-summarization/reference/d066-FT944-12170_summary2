A book entitled, "Wal-Mart: Sam Walton's Retail Phenomenon" was published two years  after Walton died.
It was advertised as a "scholarly account" of Wal-Mart's success.
The chain's rise was spectacular.
The company did not incorporate until 1971 when it  had only 38 outlets and was not listed among the country's top 71 discounters.
Its  turnover was nine percent of Sears' and 11 percent of K-Mart's.
Ten years later its sales  surpassed both.
Walton studied the competition and adapted from them.
Another strength was its  openness to technology.
An example was its 20 million dollar investment in an internal  satellite system.
