President Bush's nominee for ambassador to Mexico is  28-year Foreign Service veteran  John D. Negroponte, who as ambassador to Honduras from 1981-1985, helped direct CIA  aid to Nicaraguan rebels.
Negroponte, 49, later concluded secret US aid was a mistake.
Mexican leftists criticize the appointment but it is expected to be accepted.
Rejection  would be an unusual diplomatic slap.
Negroponte was most recently a deputy to Reagan's  last national security adviser, Lt. Gen. Colin Powell; and was an aide to adviser Henry  Kissinger during the Vietnam war.
He has worked on negotiations with Mexico on  environmental and fishing issues and is known as being good at working the bureaucracy.
