Jurors in the McMartin Pre-School molestation case said today that they have reached a  verdict on 52 counts of the case and remained deadlocked on the last 13 charges.
Raymond Buckey and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, are charged with 64 counts  of molestation of children attending their family-owned pre-school and one count of  conspiracy.
This is the longest, most costly, criminal trial in history.
Superior Court  Judge William Pounds will hold a hearing on Thursday.
One decision could be opening  the sealed verdicts.
Jurors, in the ninth week of deliberations, have questioned elements  of the charges and appeared confused.
