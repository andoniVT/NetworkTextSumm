Frustrated Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee complain that Supreme Court  nominee Clarence Thomas is an evasive witness, but there has been no groundswell of  opposition to his confirmation.
Several Senators were skeptical of Thomas's insistence  that he has no opinion on the 1973 Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion.
Senators criticized Thomas's tendency to back away from comments made in past  speeches or articles giving, as one put it, the "appearance of a confirmation  conversion."
5 of the 14 committee members, all Republicans, appear solidly for  Thomas, probably 6 Democrats are opposed, and three swing votes, one Republican,  two Democrats, could go either way.
