Leopold Gratz, President of the Austrian Parliament, resigned today because of the  scandal surrounding the mysterious sinking if the Lucona 12 years ago.
Another Austrian  politician, who like Gratz, was involved in the scandal, resigned last month.
Udo Proksch  is the prime suspect in the sinking of the Lucona in the Indian Ocean 12 years ago.
Six  sailors died.
Proksch claimed the Lucona carried a valuable cargo.
It was insured for 16 million  dollars.
The insurance company refused to pay, saying that the Lucona carried scrap  metal and was sunk intentionally.
Proksch is a fugitive.
Gratz is accused of helping  Proksch.
