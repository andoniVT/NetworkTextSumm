Supercomputers and satellites helped predict the path and landfall of Hurricane  Hugo in time to allow evacuation of Charleston, S.C., but hurricane tracking is  not an exact science.
The intensity of Hugo was upgraded on the basis of Air  Force reconnaissance just hours before it hit Charleston.
There are no reliable  computer models for forecasting strength.
To predict the path, supercomputers  use satellite data to make constantly changing predictions.
Forecasters analyze  the predictions, satellite data, the history of similar storms and the current  path to make an educated guess about the landfall.
The best information for  predicting hurricanes still comes from flying airplanes into the hurricane.
