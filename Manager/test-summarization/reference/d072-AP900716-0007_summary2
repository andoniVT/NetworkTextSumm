Leonard Bernstein, exhausted and suffering from the effects of several lung ailments,  canceled performances with the London Symphony Orchestra in Japan.
He will return to  the United States to recover.
Mr. Bernstein, 71, issued an apology and said that Michael Thomas, LSO principal  conductor, and Japanese conductor Eiji Oue were asked to fulfill his responsibilities.
Mr. Bernstein also canceled appearances with an orchestra of young musicians who had  been training under LSO principals during the Pacific Music Festival in Japan.
Inaugurated by Bernstein last month, it is probably the first Asian festival where young  musicians can train with a professional orchestra.
