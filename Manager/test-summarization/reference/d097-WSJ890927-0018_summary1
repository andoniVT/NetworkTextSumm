According to an official of the American Insurance Service Group, "Hugo will be  the biggest hurricane loss on record."
State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance  Co., for example, estimates it will pay clams totaling more than $400 million.
Nationwide Insurance Co. said claims could total $100 million.
Analysts, however,  say most companies have sufficient funds to cover the losses and premium rate  increases could be minimal.
Insurers also buy protection for themselves by paying another company a portion of  the premium to bear some of the losses--called reinsurance.
An investment analyst  said losses from Hugo could temporarily increase reinsurance rates.
