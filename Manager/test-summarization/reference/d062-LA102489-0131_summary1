Governor George Deukmejian of California is right in calling for a session of the Legislature to  assure victims that the state will provide its share of aid as soon as possible and without a lot of  red tape.
The governor is wrong, however, in distancing himself from the California Department  of Transportation (Caltran) concerning what caused the Nimitz Freeway in Oakland to collapse.
The governor, claiming he wasn't told that a freeway might collapse in an earthquake, may be  defending his opposition to a gasoline tax increase that could have funded highway development.
