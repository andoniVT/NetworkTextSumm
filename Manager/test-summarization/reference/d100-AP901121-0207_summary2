John Lennon had been in virtual seclusion for five years, taking care of his son, Sean, and, admittedly out of songwriting ideas.
But, in 1980, he again felt inspired and returned to the studio to make an album.
Musicians who worked with Lennon on what were to be his final two albums considered him to be a hero.
Songs that the former Beatle wrote for these albums were mostly mainstream pop; no political anthems.
He was a happy man; his singing was higher and sweeter than before.
He wrote songs that were tributes to his wife, Yoko Ono, and to Sean.
