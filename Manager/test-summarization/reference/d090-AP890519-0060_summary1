President Corazon Aquino said today her predecessor, Ferdinand Marcos, cannot return  home to die nor will she permit him to be buried here despite an appeal from his wife.
The 71-year-old Marcos is in critical condition in a Honolulu hospital suffering from  renal, cardiac and pulmonary failure.
Mrs. Marcos' appeal was broadcast by a pro- Marcos radio station.
Mrs. Aquino succeeded Marcos after the 1986 uprising that toppled his administration  and forced him into exile in Hawaii.
Today, the Manila Stock Exchange's composite index fell to 1,084.53 from Thursday's  close of 1,102.97.
Traders said rumors of Marcos' death triggered a selling wave.
