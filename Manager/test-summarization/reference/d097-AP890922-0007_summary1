Hugo, a category 4 hurricane, struck South Carolina Thursday after thousands of  coastal residents in southeastern states fled inland.
A Red Cross spokesman said  that it was sheltering thousands of evacuees and resources were very strained.
A National Hurricane Center official said hurricane-force winds first hit the coast  by 9:15 p.m. EDT.
About three hours later the eye of the storm, 10 miles across and  with top winds at 135 mph, passed over the Isle of Palms east of Charleston.
By  midnight, 119 mph winds were reported in Charleston.
The roof of City Hall, a 188- year-old brick building, cracked.
