Leaders of a group trying to overthrow Iran's Islamic leadership accused Iran of  deliberately underreporting the number of casualties in Thursday's earthquake.
Iran has  reported that at least 26,000 were killed, but Shahin Gobadi, spokesman for the People's  Mojahedin of Iran, speaking to a rally at a park across from the White House claimed the  number closer to 100,000.
Gobadi blamed the government for the shoddy housing that  people were forced to live in.
Gobadi further charged that the government was devoting  all of its resources to a senseless war with Iraq.
The People's Mojahedin aided in   deposing the shah in 1979.
