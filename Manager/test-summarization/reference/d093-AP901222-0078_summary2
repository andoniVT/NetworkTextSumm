The Israeli ferry Tuvia capsized shortly after midnight on Saturday, while bringing 100  sailors who were part of the multinational force arrayed against Iraq back from shore  leave to the USS Saratoga.
The ferry took on water over the stern in heavy seas and  capsized when it was hit by a big wave.
Nineteen sailors drowned and scores were  injured.
Survivors described chaos as overloaded rescue boats threw life preservers and  dragged men back to the Saratoga, which was anchored outside Haifa harbor.
One sailor  who dove from the ferry and swam frantically to escape the sinking boat's suction was hit  by a rescue boat.
