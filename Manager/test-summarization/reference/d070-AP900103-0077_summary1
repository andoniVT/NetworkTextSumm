Former East German leader Erich Honecker may be moved to a monastery to protect him from  enraged citizens.
Since being ousted in October, Honecker and other party officials have been  investigated for corruption and living in luxury at cost to the state.
Honecker is under house arrest in government housing outside East Berlin, which is being  converted to a medical rehabilitation center.
Lutheran and Catholic churches have offered  protection and refuge fearing he would be attacked and lynched if placed in smaller quarters as  demanded by East German groups calling for his punishment.
Currently, Honecker is seriously ill following gall-bladder surgery.
