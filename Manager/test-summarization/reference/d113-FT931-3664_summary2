Bombayites are asking who is responsible for the explosions that rocked the city on  Friday afternoon killing at least 255 and injuring over 1,200.
Residents believe this  attack was different from the ethnic riots that afflicted the city in December and January.
The recent attack used high-tech devices and appeared designed to terrorize the nation's  commercial capital.
Many suspect Moslem extremists, taking revenge for the destruction  of the Ayodhya mosque, are to blame.
If this found to be true, many will suspect  Pakistani involvement.
The streets of Bombay are calm, as rubble is being cleared and  stock exchange authorities prepare to resume trading.
