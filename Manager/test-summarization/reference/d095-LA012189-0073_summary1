Memorial services for the five children killed at Cleveland Elementary School.
A  Vietnamese student and four Cambodian students were gunned down in the schoolyard  by Patrick Edward Purdy.
The Vietnamese student will be buried today in a separate  ceremony while Buddhist priests led prayers at the homes of three Cambodian families  on Friday.
The father of one of the students, living in Ohio, learned of his son's death  when he say his son's picture on the news.
The father, a former major in the Cambodian  Army, had been separated from his family years ago in Cambodia, and a bitter reunion of  the boy's parents marred the vigil.
