Tuesday the shuttle Discovery launched a new era in space exploration.
It carries the $1.5  billion Hubble Space Telescope, 10 times sharper than the largest Earth telescopes.
Crucial steps are a robotic arm lifting Hubble from the cargo bay and Hubble's solar  arrays unfurling.
Discovery will follow for two days to assist if anything goes wrong.
A  seven-month checkout period will follow.
The first photograph, in a week, will be an  exercise and probably fuzzy.
After delays since 1983, technical problems postponed an  April 10th launch.
Many involved spectators could not return Tuesday.
All five crew  members are veterans of previous flights.
AF Col. Loren Shriver is the commander.
