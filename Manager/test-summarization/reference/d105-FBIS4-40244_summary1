Viktor Alksnis, born in Latvia in 1950 and former deputy of the Supreme Soviet of the  former USSR is warning of possible ethnic cleansing in Latvia.
He says that the adoption  of the Latvian citizenship law violates not only human rights but creates the conditions  for a conflict similar to the ones in Yugoslavia and the Caucasus.
This law allows for a  "mild" ethnic cleansing of the Russian-speaking population of Latvia.
According to  Alksnis, some circles in Moscow want conflict in Latvia and will use the "mild" Russian  cleansing as an excuse for stringent ethnic cleansing of the Latvians.
