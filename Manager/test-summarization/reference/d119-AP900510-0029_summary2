The Bush administration fearing that the nomination of Melissa Wells to be ambassador to Nicaragua might face a prolonged Senate confirmation fight has decided to name Harry Shlaudeman for the post.
Ms Wells is ambassador to Mozambique, but Senator Jesse Helms and his colleagues had blocked that appointment for 11 months as an expression of opposition to the Reagan administration's friendship toward Mozambique's Marxist government and might delay action on Wells again.
Shlaudeman is considered the premier State Department specialist on Latin America and is expected to win easy Senate confirmation.
He has served as ambassador to Argentina, Peru, Brazil, and Venezuela.
