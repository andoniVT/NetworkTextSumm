Hurricane Andrew smashed into Louisiana yesterday, damaging rural areas, but missing  New Orleans.
Damage in southern Florida was much greater than was previously  believed, reaching more than $15 billion.
Much of it was not insured.
Insurers will face  the greatest loses from the destruction of $100,00 to $150,00 houses in Homestead, where  one big hotel also was badly damaged.
In Louisiana, the hurricane hit rural and  agricultural areas and spawned tornadoes.
The oil-refining industry was spared.
Andrew  was downgraded to a tropical storm as it moved inland.
Two million Floridians remain  without electricity or safe water.
