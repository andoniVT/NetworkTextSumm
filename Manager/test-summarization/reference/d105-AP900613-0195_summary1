Ethnic violence killed 148 people and wounded 885 in the Central Republic of Kirghizia in the Soviet Union.
The clashes arose over a land dispute between ethnic Kirghiz and Uzbeks, both Sunni Moslems.
In two years of civil strife, mainly ethnic clashes, 24,000 have been arrested.
Troops had to be used in 13 regions of the Soviet Unions to deal with the unrest.
Besides unrest in Kirghizia and Uzbekistan, ethnic violence has also been reported in Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Tadzhikistan.
These conflicts were often accompanied by riots, arson and the massacre of innocent people.
