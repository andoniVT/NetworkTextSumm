John Major was elected leader of the Conservative Party today.
Endorsed by Prime  Minister Margaret Thatcher as her successor and heir, Major will become prime minister.
At 47, he will be the youngest prime minister since the 19th century.
In a secret ballot  election among Tory members of parliament, Major won 185 votes, two short of the  majority needed to win.
His opponents, former Defense Secretary Michael Heseltine with  131 votes and Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd with 56, conceded the election to Major,  making a second ballot unnecessary.
Major emerged as the possible heir apparent to  Thatcher when she appointed him chancellor of the Exchequer in 1989.
