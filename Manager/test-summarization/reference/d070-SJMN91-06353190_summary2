Michail Gorbachev urged all sides to take their time in deciding the fate of Erich  Honecker as former East German leader spent a seventh day of refuge inside the Chilean  Embassy in Moscow.
Germany wants to try Honecker for ordering the shooting of  people who attempted to flee to the West during his years in power.
But speculation  lingers that German politicians have little interest in trying a man who may possess  embarrassing secrets.
Gorbachev did not exclude the possibility that Honecker would  leave for North Korea in the next few days.
Outside the Chilean Embassy, several dozen  demonstrators demanded humane treatment for Honecker.
