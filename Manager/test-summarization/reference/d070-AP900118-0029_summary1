Egon Krenz, the successor to East Germany's leader Erich Honecker, and former Politburo  member Guenter Schabowski gave their version of the mentality of the hard-liners toward the  end.
Krenz told an investigating commission that the former Party leadership had the notion that  everything outside of planned events and demonstrations by the Communist Youth Group was  organized by "enemy forces."
Krenz and Schabowski denied personal responsibility for orders to attack demonstrators, noting  that Honecker and Secret-Police Chief Erich Mielke, bypassing the Politburo, engineered  attempts at suppression.
However, Krenz accepted joint responsibility for misjudging dissident  citizens and groups for years.
