East German authorities on Friday interrogated former Communist leader Erich Honecker about  his role in the killing of some 200 people trying to escape from East Germany's Communist rule.
Honecker, would be investigated on possible murder charges in connection with those deaths.
Along with several other members of his ousted regime, he already has been charged with  corruption and abuse of power.
The murder charge could put Honecker away for life.
His poor health and his age, 77, make  prosecution questionable.
He has been judged too ill for imprisonment but fit enough for  prosecution.
He is staying in a hospital outside East Berlin.
