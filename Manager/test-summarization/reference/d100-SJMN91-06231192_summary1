Ten years after his death, Yoko Ono, wife of former Beatle John Lennon is thriving.
The  Whitney Museum of Art has exhibited her artwork, the American Film Festival is staging  an international tour of her films and a new album is soon to be released.
She also  founded Bag One Arts, to promote Lennon's art and image.
Ono, 57, began her art career  as an abstract impressionist, but moved to avant-garde.
She met Lennon in 1966 and  many have accused her of breaking up the Beatles.
Ono was born in Tokyo and moved to  the United States in 1936.
