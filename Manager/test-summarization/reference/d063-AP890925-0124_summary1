Prime Minister Thatcher visited Deal on Monday.
She took the occasion to condemn as  "monsters" those members of the IRA who blew up the Royal Marines School of Music,  killing ten bandsmen.
Gerry Adams, President of the legal political arm of the IRA,  disputed her statement, saying that she knew the real cause of and remedy for the  conflict.
Mrs. Thatcher also pledged speed, vigor and determination in the hunt for the bombers.
The Secretary-General of the International Police Organization, INTERPOL, assured that  the organization would fully support efforts to bring to justice those who blew up the  School.
