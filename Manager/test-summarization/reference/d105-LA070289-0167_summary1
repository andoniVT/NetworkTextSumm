Mikail Gorbachev warned the nation that the country's growing ethnic strife is endangering its unity as a state as well as threatening his program of political and economic reform.
With serious ethnic clashes and unrest in several Soviet republics and with nationalism growing stronger in the Baltic republics, Gorbachev is struggling to hold the Soviet Union together while pushing broad reforms.
Nearly 300 people have been killed in clashes in the past two years.
Much of the strife is rooted in past Soviet policies of domination by ethnic Russians or in the forced deportation of thousands during the Stalinist era.
