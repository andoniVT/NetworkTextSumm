Andrei Sakharov's visit to the United States has gone virtually unreported in Moscow,  with only a radio broadcast saying he had voiced opposition to the "Star Wars" program.
Radio Moscow said Sakharov made the statement in a Boston news conference.
Sakharov  is a member of the International Foundation for Survival and Development of Humanity.
Tass reported that the organization held a meeting, but did not mention Sakharov.
Sakharov is a celebrity in the West since he helped start the Soviet dissident movement in  the 1970s.
He is visiting relatives and undergoing medical testing in the United States.
