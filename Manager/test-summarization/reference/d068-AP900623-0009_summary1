In an elaborate ceremony attended by six foreign ministers, numerous generals, a brass  band and hundreds of reporters, Checkpoint Charlie was lifted on to a flatbed truck and  consigned to history.
Although the public was not invited to the ceremony, residents of  the street overlooking the checkpoint watched from their windows.
One resident said she  saw eight people shot to death attempting to escape and at least 20 successful attempts.
Cars, balloons and tunnels were used to escape East Berlin.
One man, Andreas Bratke,  just ran.
"I ran as fast as I could," he said.
