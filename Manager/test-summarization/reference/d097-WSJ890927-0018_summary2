Losses to insurers from Hurricane Hugo far surpass the $752.5 million for Hurricane  Frederick in 1979, but analysts and company officials predict no increase in premium  rates before mid-1990.
Mr. Ruoff of Fred S. James figures that even if losses reach $5  billion insurers won't feel enough "financial pain" to make them boost premium rates  right away.
In the last three years hurricane and storm seasons have been rather mild  so insurers haven't had to dip into reserves.
Most insurers also protect themselves by  buying reinsurance, and even State Farm, which doesn't buy reinsurance, believes its  reserves are large enough to absorb its losses.
