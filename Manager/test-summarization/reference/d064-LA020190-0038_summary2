With 27 cash registers and seating for 900, the world's largest McDonald's opened in  Moscow on Wednesday to mixed reviews for the Big Mac and high praise for its  strawberry milkshakes, called cocktails by the Russians.
Choosing from 25,000  applicants, McDonald's trained 630 workers in Western marketing techniques.
Clerks are  trained to say "please" and "thank-you" as well  as observing new standards of  cleanliness.
The ingredients used at the restaurant are provided by Soviet farms, but  McDonald's provided farmers with special training and disease-resistant seeds for the  process.
At 3.75 rubles (around five U.S. dollars) for a Big Mac, feeding a family at  McDonald's could cost the average Soviet worker two-day's wages.
