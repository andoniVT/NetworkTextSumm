Bush's choice for his running mate ran into questions about Dan Quayle's military record and even suggestions that Quayle should withdraw.
Quayle had said that he sought National Guard duty so that he could attend law school, and that he had not used influence to gain admittance to the Guard.
However, a retired Maj. Gen. who had once worked for Quayle's grandfather said that he had contacted the Guard on Quayle's behalf and recommended him highly.
In speeches to the Republican Convention, Quayle was upbeat and Bush said that he was proud to have Quayle at his side.
