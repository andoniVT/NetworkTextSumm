Despite predictions of dire results following the defeat of the nomination of John Tower for  Secretary of Defense, Washington is quiet.
President Bush, although he defended his nominee to  the bitter end has said that it is time to move on.
The blockage of the nomination came following  allegations of problems with alcohol and inappropriate dealings with defense contractors.
In an  unprecedented and humiliating step, Tower announced on TV that he would stop drinking.
Later,  he even went so far as to offer to take the position on a six month probationary basis.
Neither  offer was considered by Senate.
