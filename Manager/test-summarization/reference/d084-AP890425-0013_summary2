At a memorial service at Norfolk Naval Air Station Monday for the 47 Battleship Iowa  crewmen who perished in an explosion, President Bush spoke to 6000 mourners crowded  into a hangar.
Outside 2000 listened on loudspeakers.
45 victims' families attended.
500  Iowa crewmen were blocked by traffic and Bush security.
Iowa commander Capt.
Fred  Moosally praised the turret's gun crew as the best on the ship.
The guns had been  thoroughly inspected the morning of the accident.
The surviving crew in the turret's  powder magazine, waiting for the gun to fire, evacuated when no one answered the  interior communications link.
