I remember the Rennaissance man of music, Leonard Bernstein, from October 1948.
I  was an American volunteer in the Israeli army.
Once, courtesy of the Israeli equivalent to  the USO, I attended a performance of the Israel Philharmonic when Bernstein was guest  conductor.
Black-tie patrons and soldiers in fatigues comprised the audience.
The program included  Beethoven's emotional Fifth Symphony.
Intermittently for most of the symphony, we  could hear machine-gun fire from the Jordanian Legion held sector.
The crackling sound  melded with the music and seemed entirely appropriate to the mood and circumstances.
Lenny and the orchestra never missed a beat.
