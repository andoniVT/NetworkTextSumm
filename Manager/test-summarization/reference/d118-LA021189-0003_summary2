The Senate panel considering John Tower's nomination as Secretary of Defense has found  discrepancies in his dealings with defense contractors.
The panel members cited differences in his  testimony before the group and what he wrote in a deposition given at the time of his divorce  from his second wife in 1987.
Tower had told the panel that he only represented British  Aerospace, Inc. on matters of civil aviation.
In the deposition, however, he wrote that he had  given the company advice on selling certain systems to the defense department.
The panel also is  concerned about Tower's drinking habits and reports of womanizing.
