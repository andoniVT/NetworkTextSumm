An operation to lower the cholesterol levels of heart attack patients reduced their risk of  another heart attack or death from heart disease.
In the operation, called ileal bypass, one  third of the small intestine is bypassed.
This reduces the amount of cholesterol absorbed  into the bloodstream.
The operation has one significant drawback, it causes chronic  diarrhea that persists for years.
Despite wide acceptance of cholesterol drugs, doubts  remained about whether lower cholesterol actually helped people to live longer.
This  offers the strongest justification for marked cholesterol lowering that has ever been  offered, according to one researcher.
