Five scientists of the United States Geological Survey, now located in a bunker 12 miles  east of Mt.
Pinatubo, are among the few still at Clark Air Base after the base was  evacuated Monday in the wake of Pinatubo's eruption.
The volcano may already have done its worst, but a Geological Survey spokesman in  California says the volcano's activity is increasing in a way that suggests a massive  eruption is imminent.
A massive eruption could cause searing avalanches that would  completely cover Clark.
In that case, even personnel caught in a cloud of ash would  perish.
