An American oceanographer, Robert Ballard, has discovered the location of the German battleship Bismark, sunk in 1941.
Ballard believes the crew scuttled the ship rather than allowing the British to capture or sink it.
Structural evidence and the ship sitting upright convinced Ballard of the scuttling rather than the British sinking it.
An ocean-crawling robot discovered the ship in deep water about 600 miles west of Brest, France.
Ballard said he would provide the exact location only to the Germans so they could decide what, if anything, to do about it.
In WWII, Prime Minister Churchill had made sinking the Bismark a priority.
