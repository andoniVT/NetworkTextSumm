West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl declared on his return from meeting with  President Gorbachev in Moscow that "the way is now free" for German unification.
Kolh said that the East German March election has to come first, and then everything will  go quickly.
West Germany's Social Democratic Party has a surprisingly strong, fledging  branch in East Germany.
If the two Germanys unite before the West German election in  December, the growing number of Social Democratic voters in what is today East  Germany--presuming they could vote in December--could easily tip the balance away  from the Christian Democrats, pushing Kohl out of government leadership.
