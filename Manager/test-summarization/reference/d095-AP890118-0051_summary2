Midday on Tuesday, 26-year old drifter Patrick Edward Purdy set his car on fire then  entered the grounds of Cleveland Elementary School, where he fired 60 rounds before  killing himself.
He was armed with an AK-47 assault rifle and two handguns, one with  the word "victory" on its handle.
Students inside got under their desks and sixth-graders  all cried.
Neighbors were shocked by violence in their quiet town.
The city has been  changing with the arrival of Southeast Asian refugees.
Buddhist priests in sandals and  robes were among the clergy called to console families.
60% of the school's students are  of Southeast Asian descent, including the slain children.
