Sympathy poured out following the death of Lucille Ball at age 77.
She died at Cedars- Sinai Medical Center from a ruptured aorta, eight days after heart surgery.
A private  burial, with no funeral service, is planned.
Jane Curtin, Joan Rivers, Whoopi Goldberg,  Tim Conway, and Victoria Jackson were among comedians lauding her talents, personal  example, and shows.
President Bush praised her "gift of love" as well as laughter, and  former President and Mrs. Reagan called her an "American institution."
A friend in her  hometown of Celoron, N.Y., said she was a big star "but still just Lucy to us."
