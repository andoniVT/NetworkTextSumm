After his return from Moscow, Chancellor Kohl said that he was convinced that the two  German states should enter into negotiations on reunification as soon as possible after the  March 18 East German elections.
He added that steps must be taken on the economic  front, and East Germans must not leave their country.
East German elections are a little more than a month away, and the Social Democratic  Party has taken a surprising lead in the polls.
Ironically, if German reunification is  effected before West German elections in December, their votes could help to defeat  Kohl's Christian Democrat Party.
