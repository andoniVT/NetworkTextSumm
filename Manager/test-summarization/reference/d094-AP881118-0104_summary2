Emperor Hirohito's condition weakened Friday, but doctors speculated that a scab had  stopped internal bleeding, said Imperial Household Agency spokesman Kenji Maeda.
Hirohito has suffered repeated bouts of bleeding but has not discharged blood in nine  days.
News reports quoted Maeda as saying Hirohito, 87, normally weighs104 pounds, but now  weighs only 66 pounds.
Since Sept. 19, when he was confined to intensive care after vomiting blood, Hirohito has  received 42 pints of blood.
Palace officials have not given details on Hirohito's illness and they would not comment  on Japanese news reports that the emperor has pancreatic cancer.
