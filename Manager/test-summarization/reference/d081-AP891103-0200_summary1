Thousands of miners in the Vorkuta region of the Soviet Union are expanding their strike  and are blocking coal shipments.
They are demanding the government fulfill promises to  improve living and job conditions.
Officials said that the strikes could force fuel  rationing during the Soviet Union's severe winter.
A regional court in Vorkuta ruled that  the latest round of strikes is illegal, but did not impose any penalties.
Coal miners in  Vorkuta and in Ukraine struck for two weeks in the summer, but returned to work in July  after Parliament passed a resolution, promising reforms.
