A heavily armed gunman invaded Cleveland Elementary School in Stockton and killed  five children and wounded 30 other people before taking his own life.
All five children  were of Southeast Asian parentage.
Sixty percent of the children are of Southeast Asian  descent.
Many of the parents rushing to the school in the aftermath of the shooting could  not speak English and representatives of the Charterhouse Center refugee program put  out an urgent call for translators.
Thousands of Southeast Asians have settled in Stockton  in recent years, drawn by the farming and the fishing opportunities in the area.
