Heavy flooding, destroyed  slums, and severed communications and power lines were reported.
No relief efforts  were yet underway and bands of youth were said to be looting in Cancun.
About 175,00  people had been evacuated from the coast.
Gilbert, a Category 5--the deadliest--has  already killed 24 people in the Caribbean.
It is now moving over the Yucatan toward the  Gulf of Mexico where warnings have been issued and ports and airports closed.
