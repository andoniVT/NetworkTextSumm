The recent tragic sinking of the ferry Estonia, with the loss of 800-plus lives, has  concentrated attention on making ferries safer.
Over the past two decades the United  Nations Maritime Organization has devoted much thought to ship safety, but now in  September 1994 it is an imperative.
Any review of ferry safety will focus on ferry design,  enforcement of existing regulations, and crew training.
Little attention is paid when a vessel with a third-world crew goes down in a distant  ocean, but the loss of a relatively modern passenger ferry in European waters concerns  the public.
