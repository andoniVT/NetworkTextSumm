In a display of solidarity with U.S. policy on the Persian Gulf, Prime Minister John Major  today announced that Iraqi troops have to withdraw completely from Kuwait.
Major said  that they will have to be removed forcibly if President Saddam Hussein does not agree to  a peaceful withdrawal.
Major rejected any idea of a partial pullback by Iraqi troops and  compared the situation in Kuwait to that of a prison camp.
Although Major is as  unyielding as his predecessor, Margaret Thatcher, he showed none of her abrasiveness.
Major's remarks boded well for his talks at Camp David with President George Bush.
