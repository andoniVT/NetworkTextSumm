Ousted East German leader Erich Honecker was arrested Monday morning morning upon  release from hospital and taken to prison.
Honecker, who expected to be indicted for  high treason, was immediately taken to East Berlin's Rummelsburg prison.
He had  previously been declared to ill to withstand imprisonment.
Honecker, the aging hard-line  Stalinist who ruled East Germany for 18 years, had recently undergone surgery for a  malignant kidney tumor.
Earlier this month, East German prosecutors said Honecker  and former state security chief Erich Mielke would be charged with treason and  corruption for misuse of their positions and state funds.
