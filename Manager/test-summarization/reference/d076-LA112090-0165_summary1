British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's future will be decided today in a crucial first  vote of Tory Members of Parliament.
Should her former defense minister, Michael  Heseltine, succeed in taking control of the part from Thatcher, she would have to give up  the prime minister's job, a position she has held since 1979.
Credited with reviving the  British economy in the 1980s, she is now viewed as a hindrance to Britain's interests in   the development of a strong and united Europe.
In some quarters it is said that the British  never liked Thatcher, but they respected her and voted for her as long as she delivered the  goods.
