Hurricane tracking remains an uncertain science, but forecasters' predictions of Hugo's  destructive path gave people time to flee South Carolina's coast.
Their expertise was  assisted by satellite information sent by supercomputers at the National Meteorological  Center in Suitland, Maryland.
At the National Hurricane Center, a tracking model  embodying knowledge of meteorological conditions and indicators of change constantly  reflected weather conditions and storm position.
Pinpointing landfall was difficult.
Also,  computer models can't reliably predict a storm's intensity.
Air Force reconnaissance  planes flying into the storm still provide important data about wind speed and  temperatures.
Before the satellites of the late 1960s, reports from aircraft or ships were  the only forecasting tools.
