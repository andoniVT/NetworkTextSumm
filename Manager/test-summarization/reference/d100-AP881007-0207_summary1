Imagine, a movie about the late John Lennon was more than an elegy.
Though it failed to  delve too deeply into the darker side of Lennon and the Beatles it does capture the music  and the times in which Lennon lived.
Lennon, who was born October 9, 1940 was shot  and killed outside his Manhattan apartment on December 8, 1980.
Lennon's widow  collaborated in the film and described it as the definitive documentary of John Lennon's  life.
Ono was an artist when Lennon met her and she later joined him in his music and  demonstrations for peace.
