The latest issue of the Soviet News included a sensitive article on Andrei Sakharov and  his wife, Yelena Bonner.
In the past the state-run media has branded the dissident couple  as traitors.
The article made only indirect mention of Sakharov's forced exile in the  closed city of Gorky.
He was exiled for criticizing the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.
Sakharov now supports Gorbachev, but wants all political prisoners released.
Sakharov is a member of the prestigious Academy of Sciences and a 1975 Nobel Peace  Prize winner.
He and Yelena live frugally in Moscow.
