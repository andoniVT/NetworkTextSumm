Philippine President Corazon Aquino quickly responded to the most recent coup attempt.
She used small bombers and artillery to end the bizarre rebellion led by army Col.  Alexander Nobel.
From October 4 to 6, Nobel led 350 rebels along the coast of  Mindanao and seized two military camps.
He then joined with the head of the Mindanao  Independence Movement.
Aquino's reactions to two major coup attempts and six  military mutinies had been indecisive.
This time she surprised the rebels.
Noble's  uprising coincided with the release of a fact-finding report on last December's coup,  which estimated scores of involved officers are still at large and plotting.
