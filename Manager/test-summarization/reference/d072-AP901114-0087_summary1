Leonard Bernstein was remembered on Wednesday by a concert on the stage where he  made his conducting debut 47 years ago.
The Carnegie Hall concert included selections  from Bernstein's "Mass" and "Chichester Psalms."
The overture of "Candide" was  played with a symbolically empty podium.
Speakers included his three children, son-in- law, and friends, Lauren Bacall and Schuyler Chapin.
Performers included Mstislav  Rostropovich, Marilyn Horne, Christa Ludwig, Jerry Hadley, and Chester Ludgin.
The  first chair musicians from orchestras around the world took part.
Wednesday also was  the 90th birthday of Bernstein's close friend, Aaron Copland, and the 36th anniversary of  Bernstein's first TV broadcast.
