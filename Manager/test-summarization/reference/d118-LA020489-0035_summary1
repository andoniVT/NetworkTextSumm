The FBI is checking allegations that defense secretary-designee John Tower was recently involved in an episode of public drunkenness.
The former Texas senator had earlier testified that his problems with alcohol are behind him.
However, a member of the Armed Services Committee says the new allegation suggests that the drinking problem "may be ongoing".
Chairman Aspin of the House Armed Services Committee said controversy had already hobbled Tower's ability to lead the Pentagon.
Two defense industry trade magazines will call for Tower's withdrawal, one saying that the "speed and greed" which Tower went between government and industry is appalling.
