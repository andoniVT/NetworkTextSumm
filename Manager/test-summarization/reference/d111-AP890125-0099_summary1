The mysterious sinking of the Lucona in the Indian Ocean ignited a scandal that led to high level political resignations twelve years later.
Six sailors died in the sinking, which was believed deliberate and the wrongdoing of Udo Proksch.
The ship's cargo was listed as material for a uranium processing plant and was insured for $16 million dollars.
The insurance company refused to pay, alleging that the cargo was really scrap metal.
Proksch, wanted by Austrian authorities, has fled.
Parliament President Leopold Gratz and Interior Minister Karl Blecha, both friends of Proksch have resigned because they allegedly helped Proksch.
