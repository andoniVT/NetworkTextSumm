Strikes in the Soviet Union by thousands of coal miners and other workers have shut down more  than 200 mines and factories in the country's two top coal-producing regions: the Donetsk region  of the Ukraine and Siberia's Kuzretsk Basin.
The miners are demanding more local control over  their industry, higher wages, and better living conditions.
Government negotiations have resolved most of the demands, including those on pensions and  overtime, but some longer-term questions will take up to a month to settle and miners are  refusing any delay.
A law on ending strikes and labor conflicts is being rushed through the  Supreme Soviet.
