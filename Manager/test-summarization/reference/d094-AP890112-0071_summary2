Biographer Edward Behr released information Wednesday about his BBC documentary  on Hirohito.
President Truman, the show claims, decided not to prosecute Hirohito for  war crimes, and Japan's wartime prime minister, Gen. Tojo, was pressured into changing  his testimony so the emperor would not be incriminated.
The show also challenges the  theory that Hirohito was forced to accept his generals' plans, alleging that he knew about  the 1937 massacre of over 20,000 Chinese at Nanking and had advance knowledge of the  Pearl Harbor attack.
BBC will show the documentary on Jan 24.
It will air in the United States in March.
