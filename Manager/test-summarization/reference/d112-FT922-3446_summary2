The Financial Times has obtained documents showing that the late Robert Maxwell and  his son Kevin were intimately involved in substantial purchases of shares in Maxwell  Communications Corporation.
According to the Serious Fraud Office, the purchase was  an illegal scheme intended to support the MCC share price.
The scheme involved using  two Swiss trusts, Yakosa Finanzierungs and Servex.
Funds were transferred to the two  trusts through the American investment band, Goldman Sachs.
Attorneys for Goldman  Sachs insist that the bank acted properly.
The SFO also is investigating to see if either  Maxwell or his son Kevin breached the Companies Act by failing to disclose the  purchases.
