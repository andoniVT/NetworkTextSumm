The 16-inch guns on 1942 Iowa-class ships are criticized as archaic, dangerous  technology unfit for the nuclear missile age.
They are the only guns in the Navy that still  use bagged powder -- packed in silk bags and ignited by an electric spark.
In newer guns,  powder is packed in metal containers.
Missiles have integrated propellants.
The  battleships themselves, ordered out of mothballs and upgraded during the Reagan military  buildup, are said to have outlived their purpose.
The Navy says ships and guns are still  useful.
An explosion killed 47 aboard the Iowa on Wednesday while a turret crew loaded  gunpowder for target practice.
