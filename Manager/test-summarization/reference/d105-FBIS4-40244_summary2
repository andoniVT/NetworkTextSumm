Today a former USSR Supreme Soviet Deputy from Latvia said the adoption of the  Latvian citizenship law violates human rights, and creates the conditions for a conflict  like those in the Caucasus.
He said the United States encouraged Latvia to pass the law  discriminating against the Russian-speaking population of Latvia.
He then went on to  describe a convoluted scenario that has Russia supporting the law in order to create a  situation that would later benefit Russia at Latvia's expense.
He wouldn't or couldn't  name the sources of the information on which the scenario was built.
