McDonald's will open its first outlets in Korea through a 50-50 joint venture, McAhn  Industries Ltd., founded with Harvard trained accountant-turned-entrepreneur, Mr. Ahn  Hyo Young.
McAhn struggled to overcome government red tape and to find reliable  local produce suppliers.
Starting modestly, their strategy is to open three outlets this year  and five each year thereafter.
South Korea has Asia's fastest growing economy.
McAhn's hope is to develop McDonald's image as an affordable place for the Korean  middle class rather than a familiar name for foreigners.
Attention will be given to  attracting children.
Currently they face competition from Wendy's, Burger King and  homegrown burger chains.
