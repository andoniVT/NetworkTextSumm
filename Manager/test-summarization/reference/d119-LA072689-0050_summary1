Democrats said three of Bush's ambassadorial nominees -- Florida real estate developers  Joseph Zappala and Marvin Sembler to Spain and Australia, respectively; and Seattle real  estate broker Della Newman to New Zealand -- had no qualifications except political  connections.
Senator Paul Sarbanes led the opposition, saying the appointments were  prompted by campaign contributions.
Zappala's only government experience was  chairing Republican campaign finance committees.
The Senate Foreign Relations  Committee narrowly approved the nominations Tuesday.
Ambassadorial nominations  approved routinely were Shirley Temple Black to Czechoslovakia, Thomas Melady to the  Vatican,  Keith Brown to Denmark, and Joseph Gildenhorn to Switzerland.
William  Howard Taft IV was approved as permanent US representative to NATO.
