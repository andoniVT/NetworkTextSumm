Keith Thibodeaux, who played Little Ricky on the "I Love Lucy" show, remembered  Lucille Ball on Wednesday, following the announcement of her death.
Thibodeaux grew  up on the set playing the role from 1956 to 1961.
He said he saw more of Lucy than his  parents.
Thibodeaux is a professional drummer but auditioned for the Ricky role when  he was 6.
He remembers Lucy saying "that's him" and he was signed to a seven-year  contract, using the name Richard Keith.
He recalls Lucy as being very serious, in  control, and very strict, but with a lot of love and generosity.
