More than 10,000 coal miners in West Virginia, Virginia, Pennsylvania, Indiana, and Kentucky  were off the job today to express sympathy for miners in Virginia and West Virginia.
The  Indiana walkout was prompted by a Thursday CBS telecast which focused on the Pittston strike.
Pittston dropped out of the Bituminous Coal Operator's Association to negotiate with the United  Mine Workers independently.
There has been no agreement in 16 months.
United Mine Workers officials gave conflicting indications of whether they are responsible for  the wildcat strike.
Coal companies contend the walkouts at companies other than Pittston violate  a no-strike clause.
