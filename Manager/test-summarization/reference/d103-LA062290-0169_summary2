Iran today welcomed earthquake relief from its bitter enemy, the United States, but  specified that aid should be channeled through the Red Cross and Red Crescent.
This  is one of the very rare instances of U.S. - Iranian cooperation since the countries broke  diplomatic relations a decade ago.
Iran reportedly said it would accept aid from all  countries, including Iraq, but not from  Israel and South Africa.
The earthquake which  hit northern Iran Thursday with a magnitude of 7.3-7.7  killed at least 35,000 and left  400,000 homeless.
More than 6,000 people were pulled from rubble in Gilan and  Zanjan provinces and airlifted to hospitals.
