Though 63% of TV viewers or approximately 109 million people watched Super Bowl  XXIV on CBS, the network finished the week in the cellar in the ratings race.
The  lopsided game was the lowest rated Super Bowl since 1969.
Each rating point in 1990,  however, represents many more households than it did two decades ago.
This marks only the third time that the Super Bowl network did not win the week and  only the second time that it was third for the week.
On the upside, the game was a good  lead-in to the new CBS series, "Grand Slam."
