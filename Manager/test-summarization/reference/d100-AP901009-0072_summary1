John Lennon's 50th birthday was observed with a global celebration as his peace anthem  "Imagine" which was played for an estimated 1 billion people in 130 countries.
The song  followed a brief ceremony at the United Nations that featured the former Beatle's wife  Yoko Ono and the wife of the U.N. Secretary General.
Fans also gathered in Liverpool  and New York to pay tribute to Lennon.
The tribute coincides with the release of a new  collection of Lennon's work.
Lennon was gunned down by an obsessed fan in December  1980 outside his Manhattan apartment building.
