Wal-Mart founder Sam Walton helped the check-out clerks in his Fort Walton Beach,  Florida store on Tuesday evening.
He was visiting when a computer problem shut down  the cash registers, so he took a note pad and started writing down prices for customers so  their bills could be added more quickly.
Many recognized him and he shook hands and  chatted.
Walton, 71, is known for his down-home style and surprise visits.
He had come  to the Fort Walton Beach store to attend a promotional concert in its parking lot.
Walton  stayed for the concert and led the Wal-Mart cheer.
