U.S. weather officials are calling Gilbert the most intense hurricane ever recorded in the  Western Hemisphere.
Its winds were clocked at 175 mph and on Tuesday the barometric  pressure at its center was the lowest ever measured.
Tropical force winds extend for  more than 200 miles around the center.
Gilbert has been declared a Category 5 storm but  has a storm surge, the dome of water that follows the eye, of only 8-12 feet.
This is only  the third Category 5 since detailed records were begun.
The worst natural disaster in U.S.  history was a 1900 hurricane that killed more than 6,000 people.
