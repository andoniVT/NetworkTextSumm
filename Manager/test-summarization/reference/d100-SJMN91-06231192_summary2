Yoko Ono, widow of the late Beatle, John Lennon promotes her own works, but her main activity is to promote Lennon's art and image.
She and Lennon were married in 1970.
Some believe she controlled him but others question if he could be controlled.
She is often blamed for the breakup of the Beatles, but that would likely have happened without her.
The remaining ex-Beatles were never fond of her.
Ono was born in Tokyo but lived in the US from 1936 until WWII, when the family had to return to Japan.
She had two other marriages before Lennon.
She now lives in New York and Geneva.
