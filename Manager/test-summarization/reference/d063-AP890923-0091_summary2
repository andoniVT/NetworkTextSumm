Family members who lost sons to the IRA terrorist attack at the Royal Marines Music  School joined local residents and opposition politicians in condemning the security  arrangements at the academy.
The use of private security firms to protect the school and  other military establishments in Britain was denounced as inadequate.
Three men with  Irish accents who rented a house near the school just prior to the attack are being sought  for questioning.
The blast killed 10 and injured 22, 12 seriously, during a coffee break  from morning practices.
The attack on Friday was the worst since an attack in central  London in 1982, which left 11 dead.
