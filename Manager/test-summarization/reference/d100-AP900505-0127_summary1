Turnout for a concert marking what would have been the 50th birthday of John Lennon  was disappointing.
Organizers had hoped for 45,000 attendees, but only 15,000 came.
The concert featured a program of Beatles and Lennon songs.
Ex-Beatles did not attend,  but Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr made taped contributions.
Proceeds of the concert  will go to the Spirit Foundation, the charity founded by John Lennon and his wife Ono in  1978.
Lennon was slain on December 8, 1980 at the age of 40.
Mark Chapman, the man  who killed him is serving a life sentence.
