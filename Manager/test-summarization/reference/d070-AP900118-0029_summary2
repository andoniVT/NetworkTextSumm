As protests gathered strength in the fall of 1989, East Germany's longtime orthodox  leader, Erich Honecker "lost touch with reality" according to the man who succeeded him  as Communist leader only to be ousted later.
Egon Krenz, the successor and former  Politburo member Guenter Schabowski gave their versions of the bunker mentality that  engulfed Honecker.
A commission is probing possible criminal charges stemming from police brutality  during demonstrations by dissident citizens in October 1989.
Honecker was driven from  office 10 days later.
Krenz, who was thrown out 6 weeks after succeeding Honecker, said  he knew nothing about any orders to shoot demonstrators.
