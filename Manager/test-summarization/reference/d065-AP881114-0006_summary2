Vice-presidential candidate Dan Quayle, 41, was seen as a political novice and relegated  to small towns and safe GOP areas.
After controversies subsided he freed himself from  handlers and became more accessible but soon dropped off front pages.
He is loyal to  Bush and willing to be a team player but has few administration intimates.
He is  criticized as bringing no reputation or staff to the campaign, being untested, and being  unqualified to assume the presidency.
He is described as immature but not stupid, thrust  into a situation for which he was unprepared.
Quayle as VP choice is compared to  Nixon, chosen to appease conservatives, and political nonentity Spiro Agnew.
