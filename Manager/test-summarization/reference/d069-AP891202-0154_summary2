As President Bush and Soviet President Gorbachev prepare for a shipboard summit off  Malta on Saturday, Chancellor Helmut Kohl assured visiting U.S. senators that West  Germany would not forsake NATO to reunite with East Germany.
There has been  speculation that West Germany might be tempted to agree to neutrality if the Kremlin  stipulates it as price for reunification.
U.S.
Ambassador Vernon A. Walters joined  Senator Richard Lugar, head of an American delegation of eight senators, for a 75-minute  closed-door talk with Kohl.
Afterward, Senator Lugar said the West German's were  committed to remain in NATO: "Without any reservations."
