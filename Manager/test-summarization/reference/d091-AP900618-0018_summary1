The death toll from flash floods in eastern Ohio rose to 20, including five children.
Sixteen people remain missing.
Dog teams from four states aided in the search for the missing and workers dug into areas where the dogs detected human scent.
Most of the search was concentrated along the creek banks but divers also searched in the Ohio River.
Cars were found deeply buried under debris along the creek banks.
The National Guard cleared roads and bridges into the damaged area.
West Virginia also had millions of dollars of damage but no deaths or serious injuries were reported.
