The 25,000-strong Iranian community in San Diego has responded quickly to the  earthquake that hit northern Iran on Wednesday, California time.
Many have turned  anxiety over the fate of relatives and friends into action by mobilizing relief efforts,  setting up two offices (467-1120 and 456-4000) to gather contributions for the United  Nations Fund for the Iran Earthquake.
The Iranian group is collecting medicine, light  clothing, blankets, and flashlights among other things.
Another group collecting medical  supplies is Southwest Medical Teams (284-7979).
Donations for Iranian earthquake  relief may also be sent to the Red Cross, UNICEF, Bank Meli Iran, and the Adventist  Development and Relief Agency.
