New treatments that stop a heart attack in its tracks, may help victims leave the hospital  as early as three days after their attacks.
Early discharges were made possible by two  medical advances, tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) and angioplasty.
TPA can  dissolve clots in the heart's arteries and minimize damage and angioplasty can clear  arteries by opening them with tiny balloons.
Hospital stays have been steadily shortening  over the past decades as doctors learned that prolonged inactivity caused patients to  develop blood clots and become demoralized.
If 15% of heart attack patients were  discharges after three days, the annual savings would be $280 million.
