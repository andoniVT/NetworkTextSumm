British publisher Robert Maxwell plans to sell 45 to 49 percent of its shares in Mirror  Group Ltd. in Britain.
The sale to investors in Britain and abroad is intended to raise  around $448 million.
The announcement of the sale follows Maxwell's takeover of the  unprofitable New York Daily News.
Maxwell had already sold Pergamon Press in  another money raising move last month.
In other changes, Maxwell's son, Ian, will resign  his post as managing director at Maxwell Communication to become deputy chairman of  Mirror group.
Ian's brother Kevin will succeed him as managing director at Maxwell  Communication.
