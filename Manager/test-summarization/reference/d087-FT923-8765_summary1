In tonight's Barcelona Olympics, the four relay finals will dominate the athletics.
The  relays, more than other events, traditionally go to affluent countries that choose to lavish  resources on athletes.
The U.S. has won the most relay medals followed by Britain, the  former Soviet Union, former West and East Germany, then France and Canada.
Also  tonight, Carl Lewis will pursue his eight Olympic gold.
While winning gold brings  excitement or relief to others, Lewis just seems unsurprised.
Noureddine Morcelli of  Algeria should win the men's 1,500-meters.
He is one of five Africans striving to  increase their continent's current tally of three medals.
