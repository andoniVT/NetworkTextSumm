Yesterday, in response to the California earthquake, President Bush and his aides flew  into a whirlwind of activity that seemed designed to dispel any thought that the White  House was not engaged.
After the Exxon Valdez oil spill and the devastation of  Hurricane Hugo the administration was criticized for its slow response.
Bush as much  as admitted that the present flurry of activism was intended to counter such criticism,  remarking during a visit to the Federal Emergency Management Agency that he hoped  there would be "less carping" this time about the Agency's performance.
The President  may visit the earthquake site this weekend.
