A ferry carrying 600 Somalis struck a reef and sank Friday off Kenya, near the tourist  resort of Malindi.
One hundred thirty bodies were recovered but 50 more were believed  still trapped.
Most who drowned were on the lower deck.
First word of the accident came  when survivors staggered into a hotel, which sent rescue boats.
The ferry was one of a  stream of vessels bringing Somali refugees to Kenya after rebels overthrew Somali  President Siad Barre in late January.
The month-long fighting had largely stopped but  refugees continued to flee to Kenya.
Eleven Somalis drowned when a boat capsized north  of Malindi on February 1st.
