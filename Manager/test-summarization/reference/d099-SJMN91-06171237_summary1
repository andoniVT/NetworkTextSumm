The women's field for Sunday's running of the 1991 San Francisco Marathon is an  especially strong one.
The Olympic trials are scheduled for January, and top-ranked  women marathoners are looking for competitive summer time races.
San Francisco offers  excellent conditions.
The hills make it a challenging course.
The early morning  temperatures during June range in the 50s,making it an ideal mid-summer marathon.
Last year's winner, Janis Klecker of Minnesota, is entered.
She and other competitors  have run marathons under the two hour and forty minute barrier.
