Bob Hope will pay tribute to Lucille Ball on Saturday with a special "Bob Hope's Love  Affair With Lucille Ball."
Hope keeps voluminous files where Ball first appears in 1945  on a show for charity called "G.I.
Journal."
They then were in four movies together and  often appeared on each other's radio and TV shows.
Their last performance together was  the March Academy Awards ceremony.
Hope also remembers hiring her first husband  Desi Arnaz 50 years ago.
The special will include special guest stars and clips from their  appearances together, which Hope personally selected from his archives.
