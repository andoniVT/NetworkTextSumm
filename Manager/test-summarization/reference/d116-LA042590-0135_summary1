The space shuttle Discovery soared to a record high orbit of 380 miles to deploy the $1.5  billion Hubble Space Telescope.
Sadly, many of the scientists who worked so hard for  this moment missed the launch from earth because it was aborted the first time due to  problems.
Possibly the finest optical instrument ever created, when activated, it should  produce images 10 times sharper than the largest earthbound telescopes.
Once free from  the shuttle, the Hubble has six hours in which to deploy its solar power arrays, otherwise  sensitive internal equipment could be damaged.
Twelve years after conception, it will  soon be operational.
