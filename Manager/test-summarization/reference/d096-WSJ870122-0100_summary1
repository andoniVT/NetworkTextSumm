Businesses show few signs of cutting back on their activities despite the new tax law's tighter  restrictions on what can be claimed as a business-entertainment expense.
One big change for  tickets to sporting events like the Super Bowl: only 80% of the face value of such tickets can be  deducted and there must be a "substantial and bona fide business discussion" before, during, or  after the game.
As long as business is discussed, airfare and lodging are still 100% deductible and means are  80% deductible.
Banquets get 100% deduction if they have at least 40 persons and a speaker.
