Governor Deukmejian has rightly called the Legislature into special session to take  necessary action after last Tuesday's earthquake.
But the Governor should cease   distancing himself from the issue of what caused the collapse of the Nimitz Freeway in  Oakland.
Vulnerable because of his past opposition to a gasoline tax increase that  would augment transportation funding, the Governor seems more interested in diverting  blame than in learning everything possible from Tuesday's disaster.
The challenge is to  rebuild  so that hundreds of thousands of commuters can get back to work.
The special  legislative session should consider a temporary gasoline tax increase to fund highway  reconstruction.
