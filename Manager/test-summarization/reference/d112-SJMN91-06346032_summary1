Investigators say the late publishing magnate Robert Maxwell siphoned money from his  companies in an attempt to deal with crushing debts.
A government prosecution agency  investigating his Mirror Group pension fund assets says that $630 million was taken from the  fund without authority.
His son Kevin says the debts are so enormous nothing is left for the  pensioners.
Reportedly, Maxwell never created the pension fund promised to New York Daily  News managers.
Creditors face losses of $905 million.
Kevin admitted his father was a crook,  and he and his brother Ian are under investigation for their knowledge of Robert Maxwell's  companies.
