Andrei D. Sakharov, 68-year-old physicist, human rights activist, and winner of the 1975  Nobel Peace Prize, died Thursday of an apparent heart attack in his Moscow apartment.
His widow is Yelena Bonner.
World leaders praised him as a pioneer who helped change  Soviet society, a force for freedom who outlived his persecutors and saw the liberty he  championed take root throughout Eastern Europe.
He was once a national hero for his  work on the Soviet hydrogen bomb but later reviled for his uncompromising stands for  human freedom.
Gorbachev freed him from seven years of internal exile.
The European  Parliament gave Sakharov's name to its Human Rights Prize.
