Scientists do not know what fuels a budding hurricane as development begins.
It is a  mysterious convergence of winds, moisture and temperature near the equator.
About one  out of six of the 50 to 60 low-pressure troughs moving west out of Africa each year  develop into a higher level storm.
A tropical trough, or wave, becomes a depression  when its winds start swirling.
When sustained winds reach 39mph, the system becomes a  named tropical storm.
It reaches hurricane status when sustained winds hit 74mph.
Scientists believe that hurricanes' primary role is to transport heat from the lower to the  upper atmosphere.
