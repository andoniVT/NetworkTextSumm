The dispute between Iraq and Kuwait began when Iraq accused Kuwait of flooding the oil  market and stealing $2.4 billion worth of oil.
On July 20, Kuwaiti officials responded that  Iraq wanted them to forgive war debts.
On July 24, the United States announced a "short- notice exercise" in the Persian Gulf and Kuwait reinstated its alert.
Saddam Hussein  summoned the U.S. ambassador for talks.
OPEC ministers then agreed to halt  overproduction and the two nations met to negotiate, although 100,000 Iraqi troops, 79,700  more than the Kuwait army, were on the border.
Talks collapsed and Iraq overran Kuwait  before dawn on August 2.
