John Major was elected to succeed Margaret Thatcher as prime minister Tuesday night  by the Conservative party.
Major fell two votes short of a majority but his two opponents  quickly conceded defeat and Major was confirmed as the winner.
Major succeeds  following an initial challenge to party leadership by former Defense Secretary Michael  Heseltine last week.
When it became apparent that she could not defeat the Heseltine  challenge, Mrs. Thatcher resigned in order to let someone from the Cabinet stand against  Heseltine.
Major and Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd both joined the race, a race in  which Thatcher endorsed Major.
