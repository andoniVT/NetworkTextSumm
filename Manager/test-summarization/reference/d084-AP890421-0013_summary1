The Navy has imposed a moratorium on firing the 16-inch guns on the Iowa and its three  sister battleships, as investigators begin searching for the cause of the explosion on the  Iowa that claimed 47.
Officials won't speculate on what caused the blast in the Iowa's  No.
2 gun turret during naval exercises Wednesday in the Atlantic north of Puerto Rico.
Eleven men escaped from powder magazines at the base of the turret.
Adm. Richard D. Milligan, a former commander of the battleship New Jersey, began a  board of inquiry's investigation.
Most victims were between 18 and 22 years old.
