Two weeks of tension culminated Thursday before dawn with the Iraqi invasion of  Kuwait.
The tension commenced when Iraq massed troops on the Kuwaiti border in a  dispute over an oil field and Kuwait's violation of OPEC oil quotas.
On Wednesday Iraqi  officials abruptly walked out of diplomatic talks in Jiddah, Saudi Arabia, and the next  morning Kuwait was invaded.
The Bush administration demanded immediate  withdrawal of the Iraqi forces and announced that it was considering all options in its  response.
U.S. warships have been on alert 600 miles to the southeast since July 24.
The U.N. Security Council called an emergency meeting for Thursday.
