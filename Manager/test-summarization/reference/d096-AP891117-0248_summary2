Anheuser Busch Cos.Inc, and Miller Brewing Co. will attempt to take advantage of the  hype preceding Super Bowl XXIV by running television commercials featuring mock  football games.
Anheuser Bush's campaign features a "Bud Bowl II" that culminates  during the Jan.28 game in New Orleans.
The ad revolves around animated teams of  Budwieser and Bud Light beer bottles playing on a pint-sized football field.
Miller has already launched its 12-week campaign centered on a football game between  "Tastes Great" and "Less Filling" squads, both of which are composed of former NFL  players.
Miller admits its promotion costs over $7 million.
