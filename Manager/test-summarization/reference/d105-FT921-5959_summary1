Troops of the former Soviet Union were ordered out of the Armenian enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh after Armenian and Azeri militants fired on them.
The enclave is administered by Azerbaijan, but largely inhabited by Armenians.
Armenians in the enclave want unification with Armenia, but Azerbaijan refuses to give up the territory.
The commander of the Soviet troops has long warned that he would pull out troops rather than to allow them to become the targets of ethnic conflicts.
Troops under fire along the Armenian-Azerbaijan border will also be withdrawn.
Azeri and Armenian officials say that guerrillas on both sides of the conflict are using sophisticated weapons.
