Unknown assailants hurled a grenade and fired shots at the home of relatives of Nelson Mandela, killing a baby and injuring her parents.
Police did not know who was responsible since no group claimed responsibility and also did not know if the attack was deliberately targeted or random.
Fighting in black townships around Johannesburg have killed about 800 people in the last two months.

Nelson Mandela has accused security forces of manipulating violence to derail government efforts to end apartheid, promised by President deKlerk.
