The major earthquake that struck the San Francisco Bay area Tuesday occurred in a region  targeted from previous studies by seismologists as having the highest probability of a strong  quake in North California.
The quake's magnitude as 6.9 on the Richter scale and centered in the  Santa Cruz, CA area 75 miles south of San Francisco.
Initial reports indicated widespread damage from the quake, especially affecting highways and  old masonry buildings.
It could serve as an engineering study for any possible damage in the Los  Angles region, which has similar construction and a higher probability of a major quake  occurring.
