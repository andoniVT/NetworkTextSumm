At 47, John Major, the son of a circus performer and a high school drop out, has become  Britain's 18th and youngest prime minister.
Major was elected leader of the Conservative  Party following the sudden resignation of Margaret Thatcher last week.
Thatcher resigned  following a leadership challenge by former Defense Minister Michael Heseltine.
In the  second round balloting following the resignation, Major received 185 votes, two short of  the majority needed.
His two opponents, Heseltine and Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd,  quickly conceded to Major.
Major's election is seen as ensuring the unity of the  Conservative Party in the next general election.
