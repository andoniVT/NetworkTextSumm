Seventy-two-year-old maestro, Leonard Bernstein, suffering from emphysema, a lung  tumor and pulmonary infections, will retire from conducting and performing on the  piano.
He will, however, continue to compose and write and plans to complete a chamber  music piece, a musical, and his memoirs.
Possibly Bernstein will participate in an AIDS benefit at Carnegie Hall on Oct. 28, but  other appearances have been canceled.
Bernstein published his first composition in 1942 and conducted his first symphony in  1944.
From 1958 to 1969, he directed the New York Philharmonic.
In 1969, he became  the Philharmonic's laureate conductor for life.
