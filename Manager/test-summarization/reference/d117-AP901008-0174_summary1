The Booker Prize has become internationally known, and winning the prize is a boon to  the author and publisher.
The 1990 winner will be announced on 16 October, and a  worldwide boost of sales of the winning novel will follow.
Each British publishing house can submit for consideration up to three novels by British  or Commonwealth authors.
A management committee selects a well-qualified panel of  judges who meet and select the six finalists.
Interest builds and bookmakers establish  odds on each author's chance of winning.
The judges announce the winner in the  afternoon of announcement day.
