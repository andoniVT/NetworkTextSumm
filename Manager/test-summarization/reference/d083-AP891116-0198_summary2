A violent storm that spun tornadoes across the South and Midwest blew north Thursday,  knocking a school cafeteria wall down in upstate New York, killing seven children.
The  two-day toll is at least 27 dead and hundreds injured.
By far, the worst damage was in  Huntsville, Alabama.
There, the tornado path covered between eight and ten miles and  reached wind speeds as high as 250 mph.
Portions of the city resembled a bombing  target.
Governor Hunt will ask President Bush to declare Huntsville a disaster area.
The  Governor assigned nearly 200 Guardsmen to assist in the cleanup and help guard against  looting.
