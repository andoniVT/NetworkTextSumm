The New York Philharmonic began its Leonard Bernstein memorial concert series  tonight, four days after his death.
Although he had led 74 orchestras, the New York was  his.
He was laureate conductor and had led it 1,244 times.
The scheduled night of  Beethoven and Shostakovich became four Bernstein creations.
His whimsical "Candide"  and eclectic "Serenade", with soloist Glenn Dicterow, lightened the mourning mood.
But  after the intermission, it returned with "Jeremiah."
Then, mezzo-soprano Wendy White  wept during "Lamentations."
The Hebraic elegy, "Chichester Psalms", was last on the  program.
It ends with Bernstein's message for society.
The program will be repeated  three more times.
