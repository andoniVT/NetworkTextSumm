The Hezbul Mujahedeen is believed responsible for kidnapping and killing four Moslems whose bodies were found in the town of Sopore.
The Hezbul Mujahedeen is one of more than a dozen Moslem organizations fighting for independence of the Kashmir valley from India.
The murdered Moslems were said to be police informants.
A militant ambush of an army convoy killed one soldier and wounded three others.
These deaths raise the total of those killed since January 20th to 630.
Moslem militants had earlier demanded union with Pakistan, but more recently are demanding independence for Kashmir and the status of a neutral nation.
