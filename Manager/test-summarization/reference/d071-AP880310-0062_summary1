The Dog Fanciers Club organized a lunch at Sardi's on Wednesday for two of their  champions, the city's top police dog and the nation's top show dog.
Nero, a big, amiable  bruiser of a German Shepard specializes in sniffing out bombs and narcotics.
He has  helped in hundreds of arrests and "apprehended" more than 50 felons.
Great Elms Prince  Charming II is a fluffy little Pomeranian.
He was named best in show at the prestigious  Westminister Kennel Club Show in Madison Square Garden last month.
Unfairly,  neither Nero nor Prince got any lunch at this prominent midtown restaurant.
