Emphasizing that the Central Intelligence Agency was not surprised by Iraq's invasion of  Kuwait, a spokesman said the agency gave useful and timely information to policy  makers and continues to do so.
President Bush had been warned that what originally  looked like an Iraqi bluff was quickly turning into a serious deployment.
Among the  assessments conveyed was a conclusion that President Saddam Hussein's force would be  capable of penetrating Kuwait or Saudi Arabia.
Furthermore, as the buildup grew, the  CIA became more alarmed because Hussein is so unpredictable and because he has been  known to carry out his threats.
