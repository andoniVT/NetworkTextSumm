Andrei Sakharov was banished without trial to the closed city of Gorky in January 1980.
He was allowed to return to Moscow in December 1986.
Now, in May 1988, the Moscow  News has published an article that makes a clear attempt to refute some of the charges  made by Soviet officials and the state-controlled media against Sakharov and his wife.
Sakharov has supported Gorbachev's reforms, but has pressed Gorbachev for speedier  progress in improving the Soviet record on human rights.
He recently handed Gorbachev  a list of 200 people who were imprisoned for their opinions.
