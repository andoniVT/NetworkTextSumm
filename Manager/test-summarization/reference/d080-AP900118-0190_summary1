Jurors cited taped interviews by the Children's Institute International as a reason for  acquitting Raymond Buckey and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, on 52 charges of  child molestation.
The jurors felt that CII interviewers asked leading questions and never  allowed the children to tell the story in their own words; contaminating the evidence.
Jurors said they couldn't tell if the children believed what they were saying or were  repeating what parents or CII interviewers had told them.
The jurors deadlocked on 13  other charges.
While unsure if Buckey was a molester, jurors were sure that the  prosecution had failed to prove the molestation allegations.
