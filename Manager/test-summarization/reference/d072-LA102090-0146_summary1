Many tributes for Leonard Bernstein are planned for Sunday in Los Angles.
The  Philharmonic will play a tribute, as will the American Youth Symphony at Royce Hall.
The Glendale Symphony will observe a moment of silence.
Last Monday, KUSC-FM  devoted an entire day to broadcasting performances of Bernstein's compositions.
KKGO-FM also devoted considerable airtime to his work on Tuesday and Wednesday.
Another measure of grief over his death was the special public condolences in the  obituary section of the New York Times, where 14 separate tributes had been purchased.
The Times obituary editor said it perhaps was not too unusual considering his  prominence.
