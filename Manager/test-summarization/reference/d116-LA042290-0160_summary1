Countdown resumed Saturday for the shuttle Discovery's delayed launch on Tuesday to  boost the $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope into orbit.
The new Tuesday launch day is  14 days after the flight was grounded just four minutes before takeoff by a faulty  hydraulic power steering unit.
The replacement power unit was successfully test fired  and the telescope's battery charging was completed one day ahead of schedule.
A NASA  spokesman said they were 80% go for launch weather-wise.
With Discovery on track,  engineers readied the shuttle Columbia for rollout to its launch pad for its May 16  Spacelab astronomy mission.
