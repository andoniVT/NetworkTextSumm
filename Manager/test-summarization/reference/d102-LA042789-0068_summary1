Lucille Ball was the movies' greatest gift to television.
Signed by Sam Goldwyn in 1933,  Lucy perfected her comedic skills in dozens of films, frequently appearing as the salty  second banana.
Her superb timing and physical and verbal comedy skills continue to  shine on "I Love Lucy" reruns.
Reruns made possible because her husband, Desi Arnaz,  pioneered filming the show, using three cameras.
Lucy was the dynamo who, backed by  exceptional writing, editing, casting and supporting performances, created the most  durable TV show in history.
Lucille Ball was not the scatterbrained Lucy, but a smart  perfectionist, who knew the world was better off laughing.
