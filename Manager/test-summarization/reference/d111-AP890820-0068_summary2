A United States Coast Guard ship on patrol spotted a man and woman in a raft about 30  miles off the coast of Costa Rica.
Several whales had attacked and sunk their pleasure  boat Sibonay about 1,200 miles southwest of Costa Rica.
They survived 66 days in their  rubber life raft by eating raw fish and drinking purified water.
A Coast Guard officer wasn't sure if there were any documented cases of whale  aggression.
The couple, William and Simone Butler, are resting in a Costa Rican hospital.
William Butler is an experienced sailor.
They were sailing from Coral Gables to  Honolulu.
