Britons expressed anger and concern over the lax security procedures at British bases  following the Friday IRA bombing at the Royal Marines Music School in Deal.
That  attack left 10 dead and 22 injured, 12 seriously.
The Royal Marines Music School is one  of 30 bases in England employing private security firms.
Considered a money saving  measure, there were calls to review the policy.
Because of the tighter security at bases  considered to be at high risk, the IRA has turned its attention to bases they consider more  vulnerable.
The attack came after Prime Minister Thatcher's speech in Ulster, praising  the Ulster Defense Regiment.
