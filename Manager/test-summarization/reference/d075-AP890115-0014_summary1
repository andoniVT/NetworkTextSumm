Although the death rate from heart attacks and blood vessels diseases has dropped 24  percent in the last decade, they remain the number one cause of death in the United  States.
This decline can be attributed to changing life styles, which includes fewer  cigarettes, better food and better medical treatment.
Despite this decrease, it is believed  that up to 50 percent of the heart disease cased by the clogging of blood vessels feeding  the heart; the most lethal heart ailment.
Lowering cholesterol levels and educating people  to get to the hospital  within three to four hours of the first sign of a heart attack would  significantly increase survival rates.
