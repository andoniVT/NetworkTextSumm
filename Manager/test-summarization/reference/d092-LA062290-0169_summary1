Iran today welcomed earthquake relief from its bitter enemy, the United States, but  specified that aid should be channeled through the Red Cross and Red Crescent.
This  is one of the very rare instances of U.S.- Iranian cooperation since the countries broke  diplomatic relations a decade ago.
Iran reportedly said it would accept aid from all  countries, including Iraq, but not Israel or South Africa.
The earthquake which hit  northern Iran Thursday with a magnitude between 7.3 and 7.7 killed as many as 35,000  people.
More than 6,000 people were pulled from rubble in Gilan and Zanjan provinces  and airlifted to hospitals.
