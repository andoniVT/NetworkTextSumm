Andrei D. Sakharov, 66, won the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize.
He was exiled to Gorky for  seven years after criticizing the Soviet drive into Afghanistan, returning to Moscow with  his wife Yelena Bonner in December 1986.
Sakharov belongs to the Academy of  Sciences and helped create the Soviet hydrogen bomb.
He vocally supports Gorbachev's  reform campaign but calls for political prisoner liberation and human rights  improvements.
Past Soviet reports called the couple traitors, accusing Bonner of  marrying Sakharov for his money, and saying they lived in luxury amid scandals.
Now  press says they live simply.
Sakharov always does the dishes.
His apartment is a mecca  for Soviets seeking his aid.
