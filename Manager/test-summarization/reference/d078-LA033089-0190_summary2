1989's films were an improvement over recent years, as the industry adjusted to an older,  more demanding audience.
This year's Oscars went to 10 different movies, making for a  great show and righting some past wrongs.
Not all awards went to box-office hits.
Jodie  Foster got Best Actress for "The Accused" and Geena Davis got Best Supporting Actress  for "The Accidental Tourist".
"Bird" won for sound editing and "The Milagro Beanfield  War" won for its score, even though both films were flawed.
"Rain Man" won four  Oscars, including Best Picture.
"Dangerous Liaisons" and "Who Framed Roger Rabbit"  won three each.
"Mississippi Burning" won only cinematography, punishment for its  historical muddling.
