After 7 years of negotiation with the South Korean government, McDonald's opened the  first of what it hopes to be a string of restaurants in Seoul.
Opened by McAhn Industries,  a 50-50 joint venture of McDonald's and accountant-turned-entrepreneur, Ahn Hyo  Young, McDonald's struggled with the government over tight import restrictions and  McAhn's royalty payments to the U.S.
The import question was settled by finding a local  supplier of high quality beef and potatoes at a value.
With a growing middle class, Korea  may be McDonald's most promising foreign market.
Expected to benefit from the 1988  Olympic Games, McDonald's strategy is to take things slowly and avoid extravagance.
