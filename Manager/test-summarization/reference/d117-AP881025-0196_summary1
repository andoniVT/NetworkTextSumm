The coveted Booker Prize for the year's best work of fiction was awarded to Peter Carey  Tuesday evening.
The Booker, now worth 26,250 dollars, is administered by Book Trust,  an educational charity promoting books, and is sponsored by Booker, an international  food and farming company.
Carey won for his novel "Oscar and Lucinda" that tells of a romance between an English  gambler and an Australian heiress who meet on a steamship's maiden voyage to Australia  in the middle of the 19th century.
Carey, an Australian, was the only non-Briton in the  group of six on the short-list.
