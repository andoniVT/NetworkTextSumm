The ferry Salem Express, returning from Jiddah, sank off a Red Sea port Saturday night  when stormy seas tossed it into a coral reef.
Four hundred sixty-two are missing.
Some  survivors say life-preserver-clad crew pushed passengers aside and took the life boats.
The engineer denies this, saying only 10 crew surviving out of 71 indicates no  widespread negligence.
He himself helped save passengers.
The ferry sank within 15  minutes.
Water entered through a hole in the ship's side and through boarding doors.
All  but 10 of the 649 passengers were Egyptian, many Muslims returning from pilgrimages  to Mecca or from working in Saudi Arabia.
