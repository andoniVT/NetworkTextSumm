American historians agree that fears of a resurgent militaristic German State after  reunification are baseless.
Most believe that a politically and economically collapsing  East Germany represents a greater threat to world stability.
However, there is not  agreement on how a unified Germany will affect its European neighbors and Soviet bloc  countries.
A dominant German economy could slow or even reverse what has been  emerging European economic integration.
Furthermore, while most West Europeans  have gotten over nationalistic mistrusts, East Europeans living in closed societies have  not.
One historian urges caution.
Reunification could prove explosive if mishandled.
West Germans are aware of their neighbors' misgivings.
