The Bundesbank, Germany's independent central bank, is resisting political pressure  from the German government and the governments and central banks of Europe to cut  interest rates in order to ease large German deficits and inflationary pressures.
The  European currency bloc is overvalued against the dollar and yen as a result of the  Bundesbank's policies.
Very high real interest rates threaten to turn a European recession  into a depression.
European governments believe the Bundesbank's intransigence is  threatening nearly 10 years of effort for greater European economic and political  integration and urge it to become more responsive to broader European interests.
