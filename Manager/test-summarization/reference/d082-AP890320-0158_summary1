Andrei Sakharov was nominated from several geographic districts for a seat in the  Congress of People's Deputies.
He refused those nominations, and in a Monday speech,  urged members of the Academy of Sciences to reject the leadership's slate of candidates.
The listing of candidates does not include Sakharov and several other candidates who  advocate reform.
Supporters of Sakharov characterize the Academy's leadership as a collection of old- guard managers of scientific institutions.
They want the Academy to start all over and  produce a new slate in a vote scheduled for Tuesday.
