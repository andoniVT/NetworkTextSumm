A row has erupted between the Bombay stock exchange and the Securities and Exchange  Board of India (SEBI) over its first inspection of the stockbrokers' books.
SEBI accused  the brokers of ignoring rules and authorities of failing to enforce rules and of poor  administration.
The exchange denied the charges and called SEBI heavy handed and  inflexible.
The stock market has fallen 48 percent since early last year including  dropping 320 points after the Indian budget was announced.
Foreign investors are  concerned.
This is just the latest in a series of disputes between SEBI--backed by the  finance minister--and brokers.
