Although the McMartin Pre-School criminal trial, the longest and costliest criminal trial  in history has ended although civil suits generated by the case could continue to years.
Suits and counter-suits include a federal civil rights suit filed by Peggy McMartin Buckey  against her accusers.
The former defendants have also fled a lawsuit against a television  station and reporter and the pre-school owners have filed against their liability insurance  carriers.
It is anticipated that many parents will file civil suits against the school, the  defendants and the insurance company.
Civil suits only require that nine of 12 jurors  agree, offering a better chance of success.
