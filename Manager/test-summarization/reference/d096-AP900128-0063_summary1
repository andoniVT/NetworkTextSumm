The San Francisco 49ers routed the Denver Broncos 55-10 Sunday in the most lopsided Super  Bowl victory ever.
This was the 49ers fourth win in four tries, tying them with the Pittsburgh  Steelers for the NFL championship.
San Francisco quarterback Joe Montana set several Super  Bowl records; five touchdown passes; 13 straight pass completions; a third Super Bowl MVP  award.
San Francisco's point total was the most ever.
In four Super Bowls, Montana has thrown  11 touchdowns and no interceptions.
It was a day of futility for Broncos' quarterback John Elway as his team suffered its third Super  Bowl defeat.
