After a very quiet first year as vice president, Dan Quayle  agreed to appear on a national interview show.
Quayle's goal had been to support the president and to make himself a very small target.
Quayle agreed to appear on "Meet the Press" after having declined many earlier requests.
He was considered a hot TV guest because he might screw up.
His appearance on the show went smoothly.
But it received little notice since it occurred when more significant news events were taking place.
Quayle was pleased that he had been given serious questions during the interview and, afterward, received word of the president's pleasure regarding his performance.
