Hurricane Gilbert battered the resorts along Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula today with 160  mph winds and torrential rains.
Electricity and communications into Cancun and  Cozumel are out, and people are being evacuated from the coastal areas of the upper  Yucatan.
Heavy rains began in Merida, the capital, at 6 a.m. and 5 to 10 inches are  expected.
Earlier in the week, Gilbert had pounded the Dominican Republic, Jamaica,  and the Cayman Islands, killing at least 11 and leaving 60,000 homeless.
Gilbert is a  Category 5, the highest, storm and has been called the most intensive storm on record.
