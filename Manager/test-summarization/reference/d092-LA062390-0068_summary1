After years of animosity, the U.S. government has come to the aid of Iran, channeling  $300,000 in earthquake relief supplies through the American Red Cross.
The U.S. military stands  ready to provide logistical support for any  aid requested by Iran, but it is unlikely that  Iran would accept or the White House suggest a military airlift.
The quake hit northern  Iran early Thursday, leaving 29,000 dead by the latest count, but the toll is expected to  rise.
About 400,000 are homeless.
Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani has appealed  for international aid and the American Red Cross has mobilized its local offices to raise  funds for earthquake relief.
