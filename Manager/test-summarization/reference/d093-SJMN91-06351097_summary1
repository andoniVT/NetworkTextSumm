A ferry sank six miles of the Egyptian coast after ramming into a coral reef in stormy  seas.
Four hundred seventy one people are missing in shark invested Red Sea waters and  investigators are looking into complaints from some of the 178 survivors that  crewmembers abandoned ship without helping them.
The ferry was nearing the end of a  trip from Jiddah, Saudi Arabia and many of the passengers were returning from off  season pilgrimages to Mecca.
The ferry inexplicably left standard navigational channels  and investigators were looking into the course change.
They also want to determine if the  ferry was carrying enough lifeboats.
