Yesterday the judges announced the short-list of the six fiction writers in contention for  the 1992 Booker Prize.
This year the prize will be worth 20,000 ponds.
The Booker is no  longer the richest literary prize, but even making the short-list guarantees the author  immense prestige and increased sales for his novel.
Critics say the hype afforded Booker  finalists does a disservice to other authors who do not make the list.
Bookmakers immediately made Michael Ondaatje's "The English Patient" the favorite to  win the prize.
The winner will be named at  Guildhall banquet on 13 October.
