Doctors are being cautioned not to routinely prescribe aspirin in the prevention of heart  attacks.
This word from the Food and Drug Administration comes after findings which  suggest that aspirin therapy may increase the possibility of stroke in some patients.
Individuals most at risk are those with blood clotting problems or high blood pressure.
This warning comes after a study, published in January, which indicated that an aspirin  taken every other day reduced the risk of a non-fatal first heart attack by 47 percent as  compared to a group taking a non-aspirin substitute.
