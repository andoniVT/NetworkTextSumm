The Irish Republican Army claimed responsibility for an explosion, which leveled a  military barracks and damaged nearby homes and left 11 people dead and 22 injured.
The  barracks was part of the Royal Marines School of Music, the training center for young  recruits wanting to play in the seven Royal Marine bands.
Rescue workers with heavy  equipment and thermal cameras searched the rubble for casualties.
The explosion follows  on the heels of Prime Minister Thatcher's visit to Northern Ireland.
This is the latest in a  series of attacks on the British mainland.
In February, soldiers had just evacuated their  barracks before a bomb exploded.
