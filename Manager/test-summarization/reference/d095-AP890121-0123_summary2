Patricia Busher, principal of Cleveland Elementary School in Stockton, CA, where camouflage-garbed Patrick Purdy killed five children and wounded 30 with an AK-47 on Tuesday, spoke in words translated into Cambodian at a memorial service Saturday for the four slain Cambodian children.
She said the senseless tragedy could have happened anywhere and the worst pain would go away in time.
A Catholic mass was held for the Vietnamese victim.
Governor Deukmejian planned to speak at a service Monday.
Purdy, who had attended Cleveland Elementary, also killed himself.
He was buried Friday in an unmarked grave.
Purdy's mother remained unlocated, listing a chemical shed as her address.
