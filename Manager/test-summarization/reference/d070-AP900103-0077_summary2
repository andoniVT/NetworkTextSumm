Former East German leader, Erich Honecker, may be moved to a monastery to protect  him from a possible lynching by enraged citizens.
He is under investigation for  corruption and living in luxury at the cost of the state.
He was placed under house arrest  in December 1989.
Both Lutheran and Catholic churches have offered Honecker refuge.
It was the churches that became venues for pro-democracy groups that eventually brought  the overthrow of Honecker's 18 year leadership.
Recently, East German groups have  called for punishing Honecker and moving him to smaller quarters.
The current  leadership fears that in such a situation, Honecker might be attacked.
