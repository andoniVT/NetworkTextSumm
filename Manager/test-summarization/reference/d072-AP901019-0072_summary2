During his 47-year association with the Philharmonic Symphony Orchestra, Leonard  Bernstein led 1244 concerts.
Tonight the Philharmonic commemorated their laureate  conductor who died four days ago at age 72.
Leonard Slatkin directed an extraordinary all  Bernstein program.
The somber mood in the hall was initially broken by the overture to  "Candide" (1956) and  "Serenade for Solo Violin, String Orchestra, Harp and  Percussion" (1954).
The mourning returned, however, with "Jeremiah" (1942).
During it,  mezzo-soprano Wendy White, as well as audience members, shed tears.
The final selection,  "Chichester Psalms" (1965) ended with a chorus declaring a message Bernstein sought  for society: "Together in unity."
