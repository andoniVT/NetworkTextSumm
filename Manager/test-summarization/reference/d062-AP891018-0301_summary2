In the wake of Tuesday's earthquake many San Francisco-area homeowners will pay  for damage out-of-pocket while insurance companies may actually benefit from the  quake.
Only 25-30 percent of area homeowners carry earthquake insurance.
Of the  estimated $500 million in residential damage, between $100 million and $150 million is  insured.
The insurance companies, after three years of declining rates, are likely to win  rate hikes from state regulators to compensate for the combined losses from the  earthquake and Hurricane Hugo which hit the southeastern United States earlier this  month.
Thus, disappointing earnings in the fourth quarter may be followed by greater  profitability in the long run.
