Hurricane Hugo is the latest of the many disasters faced by Charleston, S.C. in  its eventful 300 year history.
Hugo hit Charleston head-on with winds up to 135  mph Thursday night.
A real killer, it was the first major hurricane to strike  Charleston since Gracie made landfall 70 miles to the south in 1959.
The worst  disaster in recent decades was in 1938 when a tornado tore through the city  killing 32 people, injuring hundreds and causing $2 million in property damage.
The city has survived the effects of two wars and several lesser hurricanes, but  the worst natural disaster was the Charleston earthquake of Aug. 31, 1886 which  claimed 110 lives and destroyed 102 buildings.
