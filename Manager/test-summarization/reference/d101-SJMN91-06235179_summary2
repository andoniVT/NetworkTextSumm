US Intelligence officials, a week before the Soviet coup, warned the White House that Soviet  hard-liners might act to block the signing of the new Union Treaty although they knew too little  to enable President Bush to act.
Predictably, the hard-liners would fail because opposition to the coup was against "the illegality  of the principle" of usurping power, and fear that if Gorbachev could be "rolled up" other  democratically elected officials could be too.
Gorbachev will become a figurehead, abandon the  Party because it is "dead" and move more aggressively toward reform.
Restraints on cooperation  with the West will weaken.
