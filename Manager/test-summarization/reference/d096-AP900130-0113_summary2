The San Francisco 49ers' 55-10 rout of the Denver Broncos was the lowest rated Super  Bowl since 1969 and the third-lowest ever.
The CBS game averaged a 39.0 rating and a  63 share.
Each point in the rating represents 921,000 homes.
The share is the percentage  of the televisions on at the time.
Despite the low rating, about 108.5 million people saw  Sunday's game, making it the ninth most-watched TV show ever in the U.S. behind eight  Super Bowls and the final episode of "Mash."
The annual increase in the number of  homes with television accounted for the higher viewership.
