Iraq claimed victory today in its lightning-like invasion of the oil-rich kingdom of  Kuwait.
Iraqi troops quickly occupied government all government buildings in the  capital, and the emir fled to Saudi Arabia.
Kuwait's army of 20,300 was no match for the  100,00 Iraqi troops that had been moved to the border before the invasion.
This was the  first time in modern history that an Arab nation had invaded another and had taken over  its government.
Leading up to the invasion Iraq alleged that Kuwait stole oil from a disputed border area,  and damaged Iraq economically by exceeding OPEC production quotas.
