The bodies of four Moslems were found on Monday in Jammu-Kashmir.
The four had  been kidnapped five days earlier and, according to anonymous callers to news media,  were killed by the Hezbul Mujahedeen because they were India police informers.
The  Hezbul Mujahedeen in one of a dozen organizations fighting for the independence of the  only predominately Moslem state in Hindu-dominated India.
In addition, officials  reported a military jeep was ambushed, with one soldier killed and three injured.
These  recent killings bring the death toll to 630 since the crackdown on the Moslem separatist  movement began in January.
