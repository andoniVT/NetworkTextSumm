Anger greeted Thursday's acquittals in the McMartin Pre-School molestation case.
While  the defense claimed a triumph of justice over hysteria and hype, irate parents blamed the  prosecution of being inept.
Jurors found Raymond Buckey and his mother, Peggy  McMartin Buckey, innocent of 52 charges against them.
No verdict was reached on 13  other charges and prosecutors must decide if they wish to call a new trial on those  charges.
Jurors, while admitting that some of the children may have been molested, stated  that it did not mean they were molested at the McMartins school.
The case was the  longest and costliest in U.S. history.
