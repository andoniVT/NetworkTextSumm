The men's division of the Barcelona 1992 will be contested tomorrow.
It will be timed so  that race's end will coincide with prime time television viewing.
The marathon will be  run in the late afternoon heat and humidity, and not in the usual early morning hours.
The  last four kilometers of the course will take the runners up a steep grade to the stadium.
The women's marathon was contested last Saturday at the same hour and under the  similar conditions.
Some contestants were senseless and had to be carried in on  stretchers.
Some marathon officials have openly criticized the cruel conditions.
