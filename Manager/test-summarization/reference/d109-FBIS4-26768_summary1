Wen Jiabao (alternate member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and CPC  Central Committee Secretariat member) accompanied by Mao Zhiyong (secretary of the  Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee) and Governor Guanzheng, inspected Jiangxi  province flood areas and issued instructions.
We Jiabao expressed appreciation to the  servicemembers and civilians fighting the floods.
He pointed out, however, that while  continuing the work in Ganjiang River valleys, flood-prevention in the Poyang Lake area  should be stressed.
Further, Jiangxi is a major agricultural province.
Immediate action  should be taken to salvage the early-ripening rice and expand the planting of late-ripening  rice and autumn grain.
