In the late 1960s, the weather service began using satellites to obtain a global weather picture.
Hurricane specialist Gil Clark, who has tracked hurricanes for 35 years, said that a couple of decades ago, the only forecasting tools were reports from aircraft or ships.
The hurricane specialists were surprised by the last-minute increase in wind speed, which was reported to them by Air Force reconnaissance.
Then they make an educated guess about the landfall.
Pinpointing the exact point of Hugo's landfall was difficult, but forecasters said Friday that the landfall was predicted in time for evacuation.
 Supercomputers, satellites and the expertise of several hurricane forecasters predicted the destructive path Hurricane Hugo would follow, giving people plenty of time to flee the South Carolina coast.
