Since East Germany overthrew its Communist government last fall and the German borders were opened, Checkpoint Charlie has become as superfluous as the crumbling Berlin Wall.
Secretary of State James A. Baker III, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze and their colleagues from France, Britain and the two Germanys were to preside over a ceremony marking the checkpoint's removal Friday.
Checkpoint Charlie went up in 1961 in the middle of the Friedrichstrasse boulevard after Communist East Germany erected the Berlin Wall to choke off a flood of refugees to the enclave of West Berlin.
Shevardnadze, the first Soviet foreign minister to visit West Berlin, noted that the checkpoint was vanishing on the 49th anniversary of the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union.
The famed Allied checkpoint by the Berlin Wall was closed with an elaborate ceremony that brought together the top diplomats from the Germanys and the four World War II Allies.
A U.S. Army band played ``That is the Berlin Atmosphere,'' a stirring old song about the old Berlin, as the white checkpoint building was lifted to within 30 feet of Mrs. Wobig's window.
 Checkpoint Charlie, the famed Allied border crossing by the Berlin Wall, was to be hauled away Friday.
