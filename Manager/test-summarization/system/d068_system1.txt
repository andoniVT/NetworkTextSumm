Shevardnadze, speaking earlier at a ceremony for the removal of the Western Allies Checkpoint Charlie, said he wanted the Big Four Powers troops out of greater Berlin within six months after unification.
Since East Germany overthrew its Communist government last fall and the German borders were opened, Checkpoint Charlie has become as superfluous as the crumbling Berlin Wall.
The checkpoint symbolized our conviction as allies that Berlin should remain one city and travel within it should be free, British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said in a speech.
Secretary of State James A. Baker III, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze and their colleagues from France, Britain and the two Germanys were to preside over a ceremony marking the checkpoints removal Friday.
Checkpoint Charlie stood just 20 yards from an East German checkpoint and was the only place between the Berlins that could be crossed on foot by non-Germans.
The border crossing was the scene of stirring escapes and heartbreaking captures as East Germans tried flee to the West, breaking through East German control stations just 20 yards away from the Allied checkpoint.
I was with the state security, said Polster, 23, as he genially waved tourists through the East German checkpoint that is expected to follow Checkpoint Charlie into oblivion.
