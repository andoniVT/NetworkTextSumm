The Central Asian nation, which has yet to form its own army since the Soviet Union collapsed last December, has also distributed weapons to civilians.
The Russian action mirrored recent developments in the former Soviet republic of Tajikistan, where Russian troops have also been deployed.
On October 26-27 Russian soldiers played a crucial role in crushing a coup attempt in the Tajik capital of Dushanbe.
A local official said the soldiers were seized on Friday in the Dzhermen settlement, located near the regional capital, Vladikavkaz, and populated mostly by Ingushis, Mr Felix Gutnov, spokesman for the North Ossetian interior ministry, said.
