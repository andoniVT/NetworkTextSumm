The Caucasus mountains, which stretch from southern Russia to the borders of Turkey and Iran, are engulfed by several conflicts.
On October 26-27 Russian soldiers played a crucial role in crushing a coup attempt in the Tajik capital of Dushanbe.
The Central Asian nation, which has yet to form its own army since the Soviet Union collapsed last December, has also distributed weapons to civilians.
The Russian action mirrored recent developments in the former Soviet republic of Tajikistan, where Russian troops have also been deployed.
'The Russian authorities are strong enough to make all those violating the law respect it,' Russian Deputy Prime Minister Georgy Khizha, Mr Yeltsin's specialist on the Caucasus, told Russian television.
