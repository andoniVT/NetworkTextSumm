Attending the ceremony along with Owens' family were former Olympians Mal Whitfield, Harrison Dillard and Herb Douglass; former teammates John Chavers, Samuel Devine and Chester Thomas, and two Ohio Democrats, Sen. Howard Metzenbaum and Rep. Louis Stokes, who spearheaded the drive to strike the medal.
``Despite the many honors, his greatest satisfaction came from his work with youth,'' said Mrs. Owens, 74.
He said the athlete's legacy lives on through the Jesse Owens Games, a playground Olympics; the Jesse Owens International Trophy for amateur athletes and the Jesse Owens Foundation, which awards scholarships to needy youth.
Owens devoted himself to working with youth and serving as ``a special ambassador for sports,'' said Bush.
