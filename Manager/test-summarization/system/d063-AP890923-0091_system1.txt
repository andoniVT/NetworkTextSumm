The IRA did not specify how it caused the blast.
Police have not determined what caused the blast, but Churchill-Coleman said, ``It would seem to be some form of improvised device using high explosives.''
The Irish Republican Army on Friday claimed responsibility for the explosion, which also severely damaged several nearby houses.
Of 22 men injured, 12 remained hospitalized Saturday, five in serious condition.
Police said all 10 men killed during a coffee break between morning band practices were servicemen.
Explosives experts wearing white protective overalls were painstakingly examining the house Saturday, and Churchill-Coleman said they would continue for the next two or three days.
