It said that is more than three times the previous record of $165 million set by Hurricane Alicia, which hit the Houston-Galveston, Texas, area in 1983.
When damages in North Carolina and Virginia are added, the company said, the payments will exceed $500 million.
That amount takes into consideration what St. Paul expects to recover under its reinsurance contracts, the company said.
Analysts said AIG has told them that it must cover the first $35 million of losses and that its reinsurance agreements will cover the bulk of the remaining damages.
 Damage from Hurricane Hugo, which stormed through the Carolinas and the Caribbean last week, will reduce third-quarter earnings for several insurers.
