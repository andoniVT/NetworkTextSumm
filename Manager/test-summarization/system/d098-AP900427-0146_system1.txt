``It's a great pleasure to have something of such historical significance and something that so directly symbolizes Edwin Hubble's fundamental contributions to astronomy,'' she said Friday afternoon.
In honor of the astronomer, Sullivan carried with her into space an eyepiece from the 100-inch telescope at California's Mount Wilson Observatory that Hubble used to make his pioneering observations.
He discovered during the 1920s that the universe is expanding and that the farther the galaxy is from Earth, the faster it is moving away.
The late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, for whom the telescope is named, provided the basis for the Big Bang theory of creation.
