The current leadership fears that in such a situation, Honecker ``might be attacked and become a victim of lynch justice,'' Bild said.
In recent weeks, East German groups have called for punishing Honecker and for moving him to smaller quarters ``with an outside toilet,'' Bild said.
It was the churches that became the venues for gathering of pro-democracy groups that eventually brought the overthrow of his 18-year leadership.
``This is the only possibility to protect Erich Honecker from the rage of the East German people,'' Bild quoted the source as saying.
Honecker is expected to be forced out of the compound in February.
