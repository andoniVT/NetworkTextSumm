The Mexican armed forces began emergency flights Friday of food, medicines and water to Cancun, Cozumel and other disaster sites in the Yucatan.
In many locations, hurricane victims were without food, drinking water, electrical power, gasoline and communications since Wednesday.
Although the storm had lost much of its muscle, it caused floods and mudslides after it barreled into Mexico.
Much of the Yucatan Peninsula remained without communications and supplies today.
The center said rainfall of 10 to 15 inches was accompanying the storm with up to 20 inches locally.
The officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said early today it had been raining for more than 24 hours.
