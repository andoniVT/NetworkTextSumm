The 7.7-magnitude quake was the largest ever recorded in that area, where two major plates of the earth's crust meet, he said.
``Most casualties from earthquakes are caused by something falling on top of you,'' said Needham in a telephone interview from Golden, Colo.
In the Iranian quake, the casualty count was pushed up by the fact that people were indoors and asleep at the time, just after midnight.
The Armenian quake was measured at 6.9 on the Richter scale, but Thursday's earthquake shook the earth with a magnitude of 7.7 according to the U.S. Geological Survey.
The quake struck an area of Iran where most of the buildings are built on a flood plain of loosely deposited soil that shifts in an earthquake and allows structures to collapse, Needham said.
