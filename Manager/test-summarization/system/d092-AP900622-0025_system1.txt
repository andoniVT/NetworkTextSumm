In the Armenian quake, a Soviet parliamentary report later blamed the high number of fatalities on shoddily built buildings.
``Most casualties from earthquakes are caused by something falling on top of you,'' said Needham in a telephone interview from Golden, Colo.
 The earthquake that struck northern Iran brought reminders of another quake that devastated Soviet Armenia in 1988.
Like Thursday's earthquake in Iran, the Dec. 7, 1988, earthquake in Armenia killed about 25,000 people.
Most died in structures that collapsed when the quake hit.
``It's very similar to what we had in Armenia,'' said Russ Needham, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey.
