In Boston, the brother of Peace Corps volunteer Bettyjean Bouffard, 27, said Thursday she called her relatives to say she was safe.
``They called this morning, that's the first we had heard about anything since the quake,'' said Arthur Giaquinta, whose 24-year-old son, Peter, lives in a village 10 miles north of the hard-hit Dharan Bazar township.
``We're ecstatic,'' he said, adding that his sister had been living with a Nepalese family five miles from the earthquake epicenter.
 The parents of a Peace Corps worker learned Thursday that their son, a volunteer in Nepal, was safe following an earthquake last weekend that killed at least 750 people in that country and neighboring India.
