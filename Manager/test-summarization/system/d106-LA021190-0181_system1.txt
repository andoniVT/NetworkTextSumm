On Feb. 11, the nation's best-known black leader becomes a free man at last.
February, 1990 De Klerk lifts ANC ban and says Mandela will be released.
His statement makes clear his position has not changed in 28 years.
One week later, Mandela is allowed to make his first officially sanctioned public statement since his conviction.
Three months later he is taken to a prison farm in Paarl and placed in a house usually reserved for prison employees.
August, 1988 Mandela contracts tuberculosis and is transferred to a hospital.
But South Africa bans all local celebrations.
January, 1985 President Pieter W. Botha offers to free Mandela if he renounces violence; Mandela refuses until the government takes steps to dismantle apartheid and grants full political rights to blacks.
