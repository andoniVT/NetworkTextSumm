The top members of the Senate Armed Services Committee said Friday the panel will hold hearings on the fiery explosion.
The explosion came after two of the three guns had been loaded and just after the crew had been given permission to load and fire the center gun, the newspaper said.
Some critics have said the 16-inch guns are outmoded and dangerous.
 The damaged battleship USS Iowa steamed home from Puerto Rico on Friday while investigators on board interviewed crewmen and reviewed an amateur videotape of the explosion that killed 47 sailors.
Meanwhile, NBC News reported that the exact cause of the blast in one of the ship's three 16-inch gun turrets on Wednesday may never be known because the destruction inside the turret was so complete.
