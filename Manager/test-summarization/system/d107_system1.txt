 Weather experts discussed the drought Thursday and its possible causes and effects, and said they hoped to produce a consensus on how much longer it will last.
All of the speakers at the 1988 Drought Symposium called for more research and study.
``There's an enormous number of possibilities that one could chase.
John Hope, the network's hurricane specialist and a former forecaster with the National Hurricane Center in Miami, Fla., said the drought in the Southeast might be lessened or ended in the next few months by a heavier than normal hurricane season.
Hope said current weather conditions point to more tropical storms, more of which should become hurricanes, in this hurricane season.
He stressed that a hurricane's effect on drought is variable, depending on the intensity and speed of the storm.
Nevertheless, he said, some Southeastern states get as much as 25 pecent of their rainfall in some months from hurricanes.
 Public interest in the Earth's troubled climate may be washed away with the heavy rains that are needed to end the current U.S. drought, weather experts warned during a drought symposium here.
``I'm worried ... that when the next drought happens, we are going to have to rediscover the climate problem,'' said Michaels, president of the Association of State Climatologists.
