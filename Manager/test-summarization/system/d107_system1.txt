If the drought in the United States ended now, grain production would fall close to the low levels of 1983, when a drought and farmers' participation in a government crop reduction program decreased output, the agency reported.

The U.S. Agriculture Department announced Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng would visit Iowa as part of a 10-state tour of drought areas.

The drought may force the government to ease crop acreage controls next year to help the United States rebuild its grain inventories, says Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng.
The report noted that as of the end of June, 29 percent of the continental United States was experiencing severe or extreme drought, with parts of 35 states affected.
The Weather Service said normal temperatures are expected for the Atlantic states from Virginia south, and for the Gulf Coast states.
