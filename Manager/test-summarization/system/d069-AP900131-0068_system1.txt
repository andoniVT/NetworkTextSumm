Gorbachev said Tuesday in Moscow that he believed one Germany was likely in the future, but he added that Germans ``should not decide this important question on the streets.''
He referred to the growing number of demonstrations in East Germany in support of reunification.
The man most blamed for the country's problems, Honecker, was set free after an East Berlin court rejected a request that he be kept in prison until his trial in March.
In West Germany, Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher told West German Radio that Gorbachev had ``correctly analyzed'' the situation and again shown his political skill.
Gorbachev's statement was his most tolerant yet on the subject of a single Germany, which has been opposed by Communists for more than 40 years.
