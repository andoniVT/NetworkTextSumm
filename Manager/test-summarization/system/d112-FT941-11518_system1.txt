Fears that the musical might prejudice the criminal trial of the late publisher's sons, Kevin and Ian, have prompted Sir Nicholas to apply to the High Court on Monday for an injunction to halt the production.
The musical, which has cost Pounds 1.1m to put on, has been produced by Mr Evan Steadman, a former chairman of one of Maxwell's private companies.
Now in rehearsal, the show is due to open at London's Criterion theatre on February 11.
Turning down his request, the judge asked him: 'Is it going to be your client's defence that Mr Robert Maxwell was not guilty of misappropriation?'
