The 500-seat McDonald's restaurant in a three-story building is operated by McDonald's Restaurant Shenzhen Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of McDonald's Hong Kong.
Although the first Moscow restaurant is the busiest McDonald's in the world the plunging rouble, high inflation and constantly changing tax rules have been a challenge to McDonald's management, who admitted that they have no idea of when it could recoup its initial Dollars 50m investment.
Besides its restaurants in the United States, the leading number of McDonald's are in Canada and Japan, the officials said.
McDonald's strategy is to take things slowly, avoiding extravagances, Mr. Ahn and Awad Sifri, McDonald's marketing director, say.
Big Macs were priced at 3.75 rubles and double cheeseburgers at 3 rubles _ about two hours' pay for a starting McDonald's staffer or the average Soviet, but much cheaper than other private restaurants that have sprung up recently.
Hundreds of Chinese waited for hours outside the restaurant in Shenzhen, an economic boom town near Hong Kong, for their first taste of a McDonald's hamburger, fries or shake.
The McDonald's prices are high compared to the state restaurants, where a large meal seldom costs more than a ruble.
The joint venture agreement between McDonald's of Canada and the Moscow City Council calls for 20 restaurants, though there is no timetable or even a definite plan for when or where the second McDonald's will open.
