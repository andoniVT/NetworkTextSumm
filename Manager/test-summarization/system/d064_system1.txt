Daniel Ng, chairman of McDonalds Restaurant Shenzhen Ltd., said it took two years to prepare for the restaurants opening and his ambition now is to serve 10 million burgers a year.
Last month, when McDonalds advertized for 240 staffers for the restaurant, it received applications from more than 9,000 persons, including college graduates, officials said.
Big Macs were priced at 3.75 rubles and double cheeseburgers at 3 rubles _ about two hours pay for a starting McDonalds staffer or the average Soviet, but much cheaper than other private restaurants that have sprung up recently.
Its a lot different from a stolovaya, he continued with a smile, referring to the much cheaper but run-down dirty cafeterias that slop rice and fat or boiled sausage.
Besides its restaurants in the United States, the leading number of McDonalds are in Canada and Japan, the officials said.
Sam Yahel, from McDonalds in Atlanta, who helped train the 630 Soviet workers, said the Soviet trainees were at a disadvantage because in most other parts of the world, new workers had at least eaten at one of the restaurants.
Hundreds of Chinese waited for hours outside the restaurant in Shenzhen, an economic boom town near Hong Kong, for their first taste of a McDonalds hamburger, fries or shake.
