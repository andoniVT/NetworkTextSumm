The committee, now controlled by Democrats, voted 11-9 along party lines last Thursday to recommend the full Senate reject Tower's nomination.
Combest, 43, worked for Tower for seven years, 1971-1978, as a legislative assistant handling agricultural legislation and policy.
On Sunday, he promised to not drink a drop of alcohol if confirmed as defense secretary.
It said that in that account, Combest said that he had only seen Tower drunk on two or three occasions.
That was the account Combest gave the FBI following his talk with Nunn and Warner, the newspaper said.
``As a member of Congress, I have tremendous respect and full confidence in the senator and his abilities to lead this country's armed forces.
