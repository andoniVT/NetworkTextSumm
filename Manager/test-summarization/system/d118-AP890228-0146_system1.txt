It said that in that account, Combest said that he had only seen Tower drunk on two or three occasions.
The Washington Post reported that Combest described for Nunn and Sen. John W. Warner of Virginia, the ranking Republican on the committee, Tower's heavy drinking bouts in the 1970s.
That was the account Combest gave the FBI following his talk with Nunn and Warner, the newspaper said.
