All the performers donated their services, with proceeds benefiting the Philharmonic's efforts on behalf of American conductors.
Bernstein was given a silver box engraved with a reproduction of Monday evening's program cover _ a caricature of him, with jutting chin, bright eye, flowing hair and baton, and reading ``with love and thanks of the Philharmonic family to Lennie.''
Todd Caruso, a member of the American Boychoir whose voice is high, pure and moving, sang the solo part.
Violinist Jacques Margolies, who played in the Philharmonic that Sunday, is still a member and was playing on Monday night.
``I feel older than all of them,'' said Bernstein.
