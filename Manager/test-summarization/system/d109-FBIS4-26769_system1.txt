While inspecting flood control and relief work in Jiangxi Province, through which the Ganjiang flows, Wen Jiabao, alternate member of the Political Bureau and member of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee, said the flooded areas should work hard to mitigate losses through their own efforts and with support from various departments.
Meanwhile, 740 million yuan in loans and another 50 million yuan in donations have also been sent to flooded areas in Guangdong Province.
