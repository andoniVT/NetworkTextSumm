Earlier reports said that successive torrential rainstorms in the Xijiang and Beijiang river valleys in early and mid-June resulted in a big flood, one of the most serious in 100 years, in Guangdong Province and caused heavy losses.
In an urgent conference late yesterday, the Guangdong provincial government urged localities to help flood victims with food, shelter, clothing and medical care so that no one would die of hunger and no epidemic disease would break out in the flooded areas.
The spokesman attributed the falling water level to the major water conservancy projects which help to mitigate losses.
While inspecting flood control and relief work in Jiangxi Province, through which the Ganjiang flows, Wen Jiabao, alternate member of the Political Bureau and member of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee, said the flooded areas should work hard to mitigate losses through their own efforts and with support from various departments.
