Zappala reported to the committee that he contributed $126,000 last year to Republican campaigns and gave $17,900 in the previous two years.
"One looks through this resume wondering why this person has been appointed to this position," Sarbanes said of Zappala.
Sen. Charles S. Robb (D-Va.) joined the Republican members as the panel first voted, 10 to 9, to send to the Senate floor the nomination of Florida real estate developer Joseph Zappala to be ambassador to Spain.
Robb said later that he was troubled over Zappala's "quite thin" qualifications for the job but that he felt he had made an "implicit" commitment to vote for the nominee when he interviewed him May 11 and did not clearly indicate that he would oppose him.
