Lyng said total consumption of 1988 crops will probably be somewhat less than previously estimated because prices are much higher.
Even with the severe drought, there will be an adequate supply of food grains and livestock feed grains so that the United States ``will be able to take care of our domestic needs and our export demand,'' he said.
``Because of the large early season area now experiencing drought in the U.S., 1988 appears to have the potential to approach or exceed the drought-affected areas of the 1930s and 1950s,'' Lyng said.
In 1934, more than 60 percent was so rated, and in August 1954 more than 50 percent was in that category.
