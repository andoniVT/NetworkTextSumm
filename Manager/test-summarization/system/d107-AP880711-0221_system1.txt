Moreover, on July 2, about 35 percent of the contiguous United States was in the ``severe to extreme'' drought category, he said.
 The drought may force the government to ease crop acreage controls next year to help the United States rebuild its grain inventories, Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng said Monday.
But the United States ``will continue to be a major player'' in world agriculture and in 1989 ``should be able to bounce back'' from this year's drought losses, he said.
Lyng's remarks were prepared for delivery at a meeting of farm magazine, extension, advertising, co-op and broadcast editors.
A larger portion of the United States suffered from some degree of drought stress in May and June than at any point since records began in 1895, he said.
