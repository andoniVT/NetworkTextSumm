 Mayor David Dinkins warned Jewish groups against protesting the visit of anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela to New York City, saying the protests might insult the black community, a newspaper said today.
The organizations want the South African leader to clarify his position on Israel.
``There is a danger of many people who hold Nelson Mandela in very, very high esteem taking great umbrage'' at any public protest, Dinkins said.
``I think it's sad and unfortunate and tactically very, very unwise, because this man is an international symbol of freedom and especially so seen by persons of color,'' Dinkins told the newspaper in an interview.
