Rabbi Abraham Weiss of the Hebrew Institute announced his Coalition of Concern will hold a protest at Mandela's public welcome in New York because of the anti-apartheid leader's ``unbending anti-Israel stance.''
``I think it's sad and unfortunate and tactically very, very unwise, because this man is an international symbol of freedom and especially so seen by persons of color,'' Dinkins told the newspaper in an interview.
``There is a danger of many people who hold Nelson Mandela in very, very high esteem taking great umbrage'' at any public protest, Dinkins said.
The mayor also asked members of the ``organized Jewish community'' to dissuade more radical groups from disrupting the visit, the Daily News said.
