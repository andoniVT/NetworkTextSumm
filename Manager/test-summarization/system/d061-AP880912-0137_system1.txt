Forecaster Hal Gerrish on Sunday described Gilbert ``certainly one of the larger systems we've seen in the Caribbean for a long time.''
``All interests in the Western Caribbean should continue to monitor the progress of this dangerous hurricane,'' the service advised.
The National Weather Service warned that the Caymans could expect high waters and large waves ``which may undermine buildings along the beaches.''
The National Weather Service reported heavy damage to Kingston's airport and aircraft parked on its fields.
No serious injuries were immediately reported in the city of 750,000 people, which was hit by the full force of the hurricane around noon.
