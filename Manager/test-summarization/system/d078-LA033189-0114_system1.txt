Disney files dozens of suits a year against individuals and companies that copy its characters, particularly in consumer products.
Number Kept Secret Alan Carr, who produced the Oscar show, had ordered that the details of the opening number be kept secret until Wednesday night's ABC telecast.
The company claims that the academy refused to respond to its inquiries until Wednesday afternoon.
"We have great respect for the academy and for all that it does," Frank Wells, Disney's president and chief operating officer, said Thursday in a prepared statement.
But in its suit, Disney says a company representative learned of the plans early in the week.
