"We look at these characters as the heart and soul of the company," Okun explained.
But Okun said the company, which won four Oscars Wednesday night, has never sued Silver over his use of the Snow White character in that production.
Disney files dozens of suits a year against individuals and companies that copy its characters, particularly in consumer products.
The Snow White character -- as portrayed Wednesday night by Bowman -- was created by Steve Silver, who for 15 years has used the character in the San Francisco musical revue "Beach Blanket Babylon."
Carr could not be reached for comment Thursday.
The company claims that the academy refused to respond to its inquiries until Wednesday afternoon.
