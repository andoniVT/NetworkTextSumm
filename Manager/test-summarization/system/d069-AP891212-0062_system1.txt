It came a day after shouting matches broke out over German reunification during pro-democracy protests in Leipzig and Dresden.
Since East Germans began agitating for an end to Communist domination two months ago, public pressure has forced the opening of the Berlin Wall and pushed the Communists to promise free elections and relinquish their political monopoly.
 The Communist Party today admitted that East Germany's socialist system has failed, and expressed support for a type of partnership with West Germany.
During Monday's demonstrations that drew more than 200,000 protesters, the largest of them the now-weekly rally in the southern city of Leipzig, speakers warned that the reunification issue could fracture the popular movement that has forced the ruling Communists into swift retreat.
