Of course, some Japanese military leaders were executed after the war for criminal acts they were responsible for.
I found it is very hard to believe that a man in his middle age, in his position, in his culture and in his country at that time had nothing much to do with all the military aggravations that his armies imposed on neighboring countries.
At the surrender of the Imperial Japanese government, Hirohito was spared punishment because "it was his ambitious military generals who made the decision to invade the neighbors."
He may not have had that kind of influence now, but before the war he was regarded as god and was worshiped in Japan with religious vigor.
