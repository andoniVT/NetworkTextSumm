In the Iranian quake, the casualty count was pushed up by the fact that people were indoors and asleep at the time, just after midnight.
``Most casualties from earthquakes are caused by something falling on top of you,'' said Needham in a telephone interview from Golden, Colo.
Many of the victims lived in fragile homes built of a ceramic-type brick or adobe that collapses easily.
 The earthquake that struck northern Iran brought reminders of another quake that devastated Soviet Armenia in 1988.
Like Thursday's earthquake in Iran, the Dec. 7, 1988, earthquake in Armenia killed about 25,000 people.
Most died in structures that collapsed when the quake hit.
