Twelve earthquakes greater than magnitude 7 have occurred in Iran during the last 30 years, Needham said.
The 7.7-magnitude quake was the largest ever recorded in that area, where two major plates of the earth's crust meet, he said.
``Most casualties from earthquakes are caused by something falling on top of you,'' said Needham in a telephone interview from Golden, Colo.
In the Armenian quake, a Soviet parliamentary report later blamed the high number of fatalities on shoddily built buildings.
In the Iranian quake, the casualty count was pushed up by the fact that people were indoors and asleep at the time, just after midnight.
