Skubiszewski's speech seemed designed to reassure Poles that the government does not see unification in the near future and will insist on Poland's current borders.
``One can only unite within established borders and without territorial arguments,'' said Skubiszewski.
``A reunited Germany will not be created tomorrow or the day after tomorrow,'' Skubiszewski said.
Sweeping democratic reforms have taken hold in East Germany in the past several weeks under the pressure of mass protests, spurring talk of reuniting the two German states divided at the end of World War II.
The specter of a powerful, reunited Germany has troubed many Poles, especially the older ones who recall the 1939 Nazi invasion of Poland that began World War II.
