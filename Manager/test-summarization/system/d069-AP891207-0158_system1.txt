``One can only unite within established borders and without territorial arguments,'' said Skubiszewski.
East Germany and West Germany each separately has recognized the border, but there has been no official assurance that a reunified Germany would also acknowledge the border.
Some right-wing West German politicians have called for recovering the 40,000 square miles of territory that Germany lost to Poland at the end of World War II.
Skubiszewski's speech seemed designed to reassure Poles that the government does not see unification in the near future and will insist on Poland's current borders.
A reported surge in anti-Polish sentiment in East Germany in recent weeks has heightened Polish anxieties.
