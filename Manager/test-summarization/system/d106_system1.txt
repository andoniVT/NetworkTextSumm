Mandela the 70-year-old leader of the ANC jailed 27 years ago, was sentenced to life in prison for conspiring to overthrow the South African government.
 Four imprisoned African National Congress leaders, convicted in 1964 with Nelson Mandela, were allowed to visit their ANC colleague at his isolated prison house, an activist said today.
She said, ``He (Nelson Mandela) believes that education is the key to all doors and he would like to see all of his children get an education; in fact all of the black children ... because you cannot claim to want to rule the country and be the leaders of the future if you have people who are untrained and don't have any skills.''
Mandela was allowed to meet last Friday with five other ANC members convicted with him in 1964 of trying to overthrow the government and still imprisoned in Cape Town, according to Dullah Omar, a family friend and attorney.
 The largest family group to visit black leader Nelson Mandela since he was jailed 27 years ago gathered in Cape Town for a meeting Tuesday with the prisoner on his 71st birthday.
January, 1985 President Pieter W. Botha offers to free Mandela if he renounces violence; Mandela refuses until the government takes steps to dismantle apartheid and grants full political rights to blacks.
