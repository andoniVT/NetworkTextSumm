South Africas white-minority government says it will free Mandela only if he renounces the use of violence by forces seeking political power for blacks in the country.
A representative of the African National Congress said Saturday the South African government may release black nationalist leader Nelson Mandela as early as Tuesday.
There are very strong rumors in South Africa today that on Nov. 15 Nelson Mandela will be released, said Yusef Saloojee, chief representative in Canada for the ANC, which is fighting to end white-minority rule in South Africa.
Four imprisoned African National Congress leaders, convicted in 1964 with Nelson Mandela, were allowed to visit their ANC colleague at his isolated prison house, an activist said today.
Commonwealth Secretary General Shridath Ramphal said Mandelas safety must be guaranteed by the South African government and that until change there becomes irreversible, the Commonwealth will sustain its pressure for the end of apartheid.
From behind bars, Nelson Mandela has dominated the fight for black rights in South Africa.
Mandela the 70-year-old leader of the ANC jailed 27 years ago, was sentenced to life in prison for conspiring to overthrow the South African government.
Mrs. Mandela showed reporters a huge cardboard birthday card in the black, green and yellow colors of the outlawed African National Congress, the largest guerrilla group fighting the government.
