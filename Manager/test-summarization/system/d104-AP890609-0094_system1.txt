Demonstrators planned another rally later in the day outside the United Nations.
The funeral procession stretched for blocks through Chinatown, tying up traffic.
``We must never allow them to crush another body.''
``This has united the Chinese people for one cause _ to overthrow the government and establish democracy,'' said Peter Lee, one of the student organizers of the service.
As they headed up Mulberry Street, a major street in Chinatown, they walked beneath a 30-foot black banner strung across the road.
After the service and several speeches, the crowd marched through the streets of Chinatown, led by a casket and a traditional Chinese funeral bier containing fruit and incense.
