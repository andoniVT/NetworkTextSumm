Defense Department spokesman Dan Howard said the explosion may have resulted from the blast of a 110-pound gunpowder bag used to fire shells that weigh more than a ton a distance of up to 23 miles.
He said he wanted to "express my regrets, especially to the families" of the victims.
The Iowa headed toward Roosevelt Roads Naval Base in Puerto Rico.
It also saw service in the Korean War.
The spokesman said he had no word on the number of injured.
"We assume it was a powder bag," Howard said in Brussels.
Each of the ship's nine guns requires a crew of 60 to 70 to operate it, with 20 to 30 people in the turret and the others below, sending up shells and powder bags.
