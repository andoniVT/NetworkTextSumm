``When a major earthquake and a major hurricane hit back-to-back, you can bet it will stretch Red Cross disaster resources and manpower,'' said Bob Vessey, director of disaster services in Washington, D.C.
Then Hugo came along, triggering an effort the agency estimates will cost $42 million _ the most ever.
The Red Cross began its fiscal year July 1 with $18.5 million in its disaster budget, and had spent 40 percent by September.
But some officials said the disaster could strain the coffers of private agencies and those of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which was criticized for its response to the storm-lashed Carolinas.
