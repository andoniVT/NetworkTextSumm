An afternoon thunderstorm in east-central Alabama formed a tornado which damaged at least one home, and the Clay County Sheriff's office said an unknown number of people were injured in one house.
Southern Illinois was also hard hit by the storms, with one woman killed by a falling tree, about 20 people injured and power lines downed.
Storms in the area generated wind estimated at 80 to 100 mph, the weather service said.
As much as 1 to 2 feet of snow was possible by Thursday morning along the Lake Superior shore of Wisconsin.
Light snow associated with an arctic cold front extended from eastern Wyoming and northeastern Colorado into western Minnesota.
