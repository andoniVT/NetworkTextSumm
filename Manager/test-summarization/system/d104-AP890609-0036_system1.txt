``They look like they ,'' said one local resident.
Troops moved back their barricades, making it possible for city residents to walk to the edge of the square, which for seven weeks stood at the heart of the movement.
The government says nearly 300 people, mostly soldiers, were killed; diplomats and Chinese say up to 3,000 died.
A crowd of officials stood on the roof of the Great Hall of the People, overlooking the square.
From this same roof five days earlier officials watched as a jubilant mass of demonstrators enveloped 5,000 troops and blocked their entry to the square.
When students built the statue last week, for a few days it became a symbol of the movement for democratic reforms and an end to official corruption.
