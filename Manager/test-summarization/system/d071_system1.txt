 More than 2,500 dogs, representing 138 breeds, will compete for prizes at Sunday's All Breed Dog Show and Obedience Trials at the Los Angeles Sports Arena.
The Remondis also say Mr. Attalla has bought a Rottweiler to show in another category and doesn't want to spend money on both Cory and the other dog.
"; McFadden said he handles an average of 20 to 25 dogs at each show and works around 120 shows a year all over the U.S.
The Remondis argue that the retirement "fraudulently" deprives them of their opportunity to show Cory, a dog who they assert "is in the best condition of his life."
The dogs are frequent winners in best of breed and best of show categories.
This was in contrast to 1987, before the uprising began, when a World Dog Show competition attracted scores of foreign competitors to Israel.
Other attractions include the appearance of Warren Eckstein, radio host of "Pet Show," who will answer behavioral questions about dogs (as well as cats, pigs and goldfish, if he's asked); free veterinary advice; a demonstration of how 4-H youngsters help train puppies to become guide dogs, and more than 70 vendors selling dog paraphernalia.
One of the dog's three owners thinks the kennel-club world has seen enough of Cory, who is four years old.
