; Eleven Somalis drowned when a boat capsized off Kenya near Lamu, north of Malindi, on Feb. 1.
; Another boat sent by the hotel ferried 15 people at a time to shore, said the Nation.
; The hotel sent a small boat to help save those still on the sinking vessel, but rescue workers had to cut the lifeline when too many people grabbed hold, according to Ngare.
; First word of the accident came when two survivors staggered into the Jambo Club tourist hotel, manager Barney Ngare was quoted as saying by the Sunday Nation.
; Abdi Mohammed Ali, a survivor, was quoted as telling the Standard newspaper that most of those who drowned were on the ship's lower deck.
