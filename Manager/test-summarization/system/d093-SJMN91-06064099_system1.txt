 First accounts of the accident were reported Sunday in Kenyan newspapers.
; The fighting appears largely to have stopped since the rebel United Somali Congress established an interim government, but refugees continue to arrive in Kenya.
; Police, navy divers, tourists and local residents had recovered about 130 bodies by Saturday afternoon, but 50 victims were believed still trapped in the sunken vessel, according to the newspapers.
; The boat with the refugees had set sail from the Somali town of Kismayo, 250 miles north of Malindi, on Feb. 26.; It was one of a stream of vessels that brought thousands of Somalis seeking refuge to Kenya since rebels overthrew Somalian President Mohamed Siad Barre in late January.
