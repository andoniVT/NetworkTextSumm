On Tuesday, deliberations were halted at midday because a juror became ill. On Wednesday, the talks did not begin until 1 p.m. because another juror's child was ill. No alternates remain in the case and the judge has worried that losing one of the 12 remaining jurors would force a mistrial.
Among those were Buckey's sister, Peggy Ann, and his grandmother, Virginia McMartin, who founded the prestigious but now defunct nursery school.
Five women teachers who worked at the McMartin Pre-School had charges against them dismissed.
Buckey and his mother were the only defendants required to stand trial after an 18-month preliminary hearing.
