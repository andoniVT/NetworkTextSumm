Only two Category 5 hurricanes have hit the United States _ the 1935 storm that killed 408 people in Florida and Hurricane Camille that devastated the Mississippi coast in 1969 and killed 256 people.
Such storms have maximum sustained winds greater than 155 mph and can cause catastrophic damage.
The hurricane center said Gilbert was the most intense storm on record in terms of barometric pressure.
Civil defense officials in the Dominican Republic, sideswiped Sunday by the storm, reported five people were known dead.
Jamaican Prime Minister Edward Seaga said late Tuesday that at least six people were killed, and an estimated 60,000 were left homeless in ``the worst natural disaster in the modern history of Jamaica.''
