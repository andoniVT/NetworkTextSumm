Nearly all of the deaths and injuries occurred Saturday night and early Sunday when troops, firing randomly into large crowds, smashed through barricades to reach Tiananmen square and attack demonstrators demanding democratic reforms.
Some officials of China's Red Cross said 2,600 people were killed but Beijing's Red Cross office has refused to provide any figures.
Probably fewer than 10,000 people were in the square when the troops moved in and most were able to escape unharmed.
One doctor said Sunday that a quick check of 10 hospitals placed the death toll at 500.
One Hong Kong newspaper reported 5,000 deaths and 30,000 injured.
