Troops manning checkpoints in central Beijing continue to fire on unfriendly crowds and victims fall.
The exact number of people killed may never be known.
Yuan's statement said only 23 of the 300 people fatally injured were students.
There were rumors that after the square was cleared troops burned many corpses in large bonfires and other bodies were removed by helicopters and garbage trucks to minimize the death count.
Beijing University students said 150 of their fellow students who were in the square are missing.
But students who had joined the Tiananmen occupation said hundreds of colleagues from the Academy of Fine Arts who were huddled around their ``Goddess of Democracy'' statue in the square were shot or crushed by tanks.
