; Outside the hearing room, abortion-rights advocates said Thomas should not be allowed to disavow past comments they say show he would vote to ban most, if not all, abortions.
He said Thomas had been asked more than 70 questions about his abortion views even though Justice David H. Souter was asked only 36 such questions during his confirmation hearings last year.
Asked several times by Sen. Herb Kohl, D-Wis., about womens right to end their pregnancies, Thomas said, Whether or not I have a view is irrelevant.
; Thomas said Senate confirmation of his nomination would give him an opportunity to serve and give back and to bring something different to the court.
; Moderate Republican Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, who often casts a swing vote on the committee, said he was not troubled by Thomas shift toward more moderate views at the hearings.
; Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said he could not understand how Thomas prior statements touching on the 1973 abortion decision could have been made without considering its content.
; Heflin cited the appearance of a confirmation conversion and said it may raise questions of Thomas integrity and temperament.
After still another Thomas answer, Biden said, Thats not the question I asked you, judge.
