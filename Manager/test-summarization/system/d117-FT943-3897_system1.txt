Between 1861 and 1894, when the population of the UK was half that of today and the literate population smaller still, Mrs Henry Wood's East Lynne sold 400,000 copies.
Why was fiction so much closer to the public heart in 1894?
It is now seen as Moore's best work, but in 1894 it had problems finding a publisher and the powerful circulating libraries refused to take it.
The fantasy element of fiction, in which we identify with characters as if we know them, was answered in the 19th century by the novel; in the 20th century we have TV soaps.
It is unlikely that the 1994 Booker choices will speak as eloquently of new trends today.
