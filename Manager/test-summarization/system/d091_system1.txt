Divers worked where the two creeks empty into the Ohio.
The digging will continue at least through Tuesday, Fire Chief Mark Badia said.
Investigators Sunday blamed the flash floods on an unusually heavy rainstorm that overwhelmed the designed flow capacities of three bridges over the creeks.
The Wegee and Pipe creeks overflowed Thursday night during storms that poured 5 1/2 inches of rain onto eastern Ohio in 3 1/2 hours.
As rescue efforts continued, the National Guard cleared roads and bridges leading into the stricken area.
The "dams" broke under the water pressure.
Eighteen Ohio counties have been declared federal disaster areas since tornadoes and flooding first struck May 25.
Workers used shovels and picks to dig along the creek banks, and sifted through debris at places marked with red flags, where search dogs indicated they had detected human scents, National Guard Capt.
That left 18 still missing, Vogt said.
Badia said rainwater running down hillsides forced debris into the creeks, forming dams at each bridge.
Twenty-three dog teams from four states were searching for victims.
Eighteen people remained missing.
Officials were comparing county property lists and data from the Census Bureau with information from residents and relatives, Boling said.
Janice Trigg's daughter, Kerri, was among nearly three dozen still missing Saturday night, two days after the floods hit eastern Ohio.
