Tass said Gorbachev made other proposals on how to resolve ethnic tensions, including an increase in power for each of the country's 15 republics, a law on ``equal use'' of the more than 100 languages spoken in the Soviet Union and some economic autonomy for the country's republics and regions.
Gorbachev outlined the reasons for a ``current aggravation'' of tensions between ethnic groups in some regions of the Soviet Union, Tass said.
Although limited so far in scope, some of the ethnic conflicts could grow to the point where various regions of the country would be thrown into virtual civil war, Gorbachev suggested, and some national republics could find themselves in violent disputes with their neighbors.
Russia and Georgia were cautiously optimistic that Ossetia could be the first region of the former Soviet Union where armed conflict could be resolved with the help of 'political measures and actions'.
With serious ethnic clashes in Soviet Central Asia over the past month, with troops needed to maintain the peace in the southern republics of Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia and with nationalism growing stronger in the Baltic republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, Gorbachev is struggling to hold the Soviet Union together as a state while he pushes broad reforms that he believes will resolve most of the grievances.
