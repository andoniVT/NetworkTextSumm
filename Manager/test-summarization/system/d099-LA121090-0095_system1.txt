By the time most people were starting their first cup of coffee Sunday morning, Benjamin Paredez Martinez of Ecatepec, Mexico, and Kathy Smith of Newport Beach were crowned winners in the San Diego Marathon at the Oceanside pier, efforts than earned them $2,000 apiece.
Smith earlier this year ran the Long Beach Marathon, where she finished seventh but has been concentrating on this distance for just a year.
"Last year I led from Miles 13 to 22," Smith said.
Smith said she and Ireland ran together -- they even chatted -- through the 20-mile mark, until Smith got her feet working faster than her mouth.
