There were no details on the negotiations, but sources said the meetings will continue Wednesday.
On Tuesday, the Iraqi delegation left Baghdad without any public announcement.
The diplomats, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the troops have been concentrated along the border since last week, when Iraq began threatening Kuwait.
The diplomats said the number of troops was at first difficult to determine.
Iraq also demanded that Kuwait forgive $15 billion in loans it extended to Baghdad during the eight-year Iran-Iraq war.
Iraq's tough talk appeared to have succeeded.
OPEC member states also agreed to a longstanding Iraqi demand to raised target crude oil prices from $18 to $21 a barrel.
