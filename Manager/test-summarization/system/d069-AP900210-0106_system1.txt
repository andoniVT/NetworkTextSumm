According to ADN, the demonstrators, who came from church and citizens' groups as well as from the town council, issued a statement calling for civilian use of the base.
The protesters, from the East German town of Prenzlau, claimed the Soviets had backed out of disarmament plans by replacing a tank unit that had been stationed at a military base there with helicopters, ADN reported.
Also Saturday, more than 100 East Germans protested in front of the Soviet Embassy in East Berlin against the stationing of Soviet helicopters in their country, ADN said.
``If the situation has changed, the East German government must say so,'' said Waigel, a conservative who has been pushing for establishment of a common currency for the two states.
