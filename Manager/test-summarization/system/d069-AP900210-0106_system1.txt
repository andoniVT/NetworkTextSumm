The protesters, from the East German town of Prenzlau, claimed the Soviets had backed out of disarmament plans by replacing a tank unit that had been stationed at a military base there with helicopters, ADN reported.
Also Saturday, more than 100 East Germans protested in front of the Soviet Embassy in East Berlin against the stationing of Soviet helicopters in their country, ADN said.
Earlier Saturday, West German Finance Minister Theo Waigel said the East German economy was in a ``sorrowful state'' and urged the East German government to release details on its financial situation.
``Things are escalating,'' Waigel said in an interview with West Berlin radio.
