A U.S. diplomat said Washington had instructed ``American citizens living in or visiting Iraq and Kuwait to leave when circumstances permit.''
The ``provisional government of free Kuwait'' set up by Iraq had threatened Sunday to hold hostage citizens of countries imposing sanctions on it.
Jordan's borders with Iraq had been closed from the Iraqi side since Thursday morning, when Iraq invaded Kuwait.
The businessman, who arrived in London on a British Airways flight from Bahrain today, said Kuwaitis and expatriates, including Westerners, were joining convoys to escape the Iraqi forces.
In addition, a Kuwaiti businessman said about 1,000 people a day were fleeing Kuwait through the desert to Saudi Arabia.
