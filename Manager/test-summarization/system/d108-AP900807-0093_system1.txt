A U.S. diplomat said Washington had instructed ``American citizens living in or visiting Iraq and Kuwait to leave when circumstances permit.''
A British Airways spokeswoman said today a ``substantial'' number of those passengers arrived safely in Baghdad on Monday.
It was not immediately known if there were Americans on board.
In addition, a Kuwaiti businessman said about 1,000 people a day were fleeing Kuwait through the desert to Saudi Arabia.
They include more than 350 who were on a British Airways flight that was caught in the unrest in Kuwait.
Among the passengers were 28 Americans, who also turned up in a Baghdad hotel and appear to be fine, a U.S. official said in Washington.
