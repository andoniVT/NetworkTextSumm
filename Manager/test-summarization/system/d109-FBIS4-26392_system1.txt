However, due to continued rains over the last few days, the water level in the upper reaches west of Ganzhou has begun to rise again.
Dike reinforcing work needs to be stepped up.
Because the water level has remained high for a long period, several dangerous situations have occured along the river's dikes.
The situation in the Xiang Jiang is also not an easy one.
With these factors combined, the Zhujiang Delta, which has a developed economy and a forest of factories, will face the most rigorous flood water test since the liberation of the country.
In particular, the sea tide may add to the flood waters on 25 June.
