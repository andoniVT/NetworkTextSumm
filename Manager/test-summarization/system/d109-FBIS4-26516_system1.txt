The consecutive flood has made agricultural production situation there more grim.
Even if in the normal years, grain output there is not self- sufficient.
Per capita possession of cultivated land in Fujian is only 0.05 mu.
In May, the city was hit by the heavy rainstorm and had big losses and now it suffers again from the flood with some 600 000 mu of crops damaged by flood and 200 million kilogram grain expected to be lost.
 Fuzhou, June 22 (CNS) -- Flood lasting for ten or more days in Fujian Province has brought about heavy losses in agriculture there.
Disaster-relief groups have been sent to the flood-stricken areas striving for minimizing losses.
