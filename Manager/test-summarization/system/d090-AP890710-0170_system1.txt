``What we need to complete the equation are two elements essential to the German recovery _ debt relief and investments,'' Mrs. Aquino said.
She said that since her government took over in 1986, the country's growth rate of minus 10 percent under Marcos in 1985 had improved to a rate of plus 6.7 percent by 1988.
Mrs. Aquino said the Philippines' debt was projected to increase to $29 billion by year's end but that much was money that ``was in fact stolen by the previous government'' of ousted dictator Ferdinand Marcos.
``We have paid as careful attention to the consequences of runaway inflation and devaluation as Germany in the light of her own experiences between the wars,'' she said.
