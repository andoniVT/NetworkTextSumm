 President Corazon Aquino of the Philippines on Monday asked government and industrial leaders to expand economic ties with her nation.
``What we need to complete the equation are two elements essential to the German recovery _ debt relief and investments,'' Mrs. Aquino said.
Mrs. Aquino said the Philippines' debt was projected to increase to $29 billion by year's end but that much was money that ``was in fact stolen by the previous government'' of ousted dictator Ferdinand Marcos.
``We have tried by sound fiscal policies not to buy recovery at the price of inflation, nor debt relief at the price of national honor,'' she said in a speech to the West German Chamber of Industry and Trade.
