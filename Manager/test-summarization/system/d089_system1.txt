In Georgia, five people were injured, four critically, and at least 200 people evacuated after a tornado struck two mobile home parks and an interstate highway near Palmetto, about 25 miles southeast of Atlanta, authorities said.
Record highs were recorded in Binghamton, N.Y., where it was 61 degrees, Bridgeport, Conn., (66), and Burlington, Vt., (69).
Tall cranes lifted the heavy rubble, while workers with flashlights picked through the smaller pieces.
Winter storm warnings were posted for much of lower Michigan, northwestern upper Michigan and north central Indiana.
The roadway was strewn with used bandages and medical gloves left by emergency workers treating the injured.
The storm churned around a collision of record warm air and extremely cold air.
Hunt assigned nearly 200 Guardsmen to assist in the cleanup and help law officers guard against looting.
A tornado slammed into a shopping district, a residential area and a school Wednesday, killing at least 14 people, injuring nearly 300 and trapping many others in their cars and homes, police said.
High temperature records fell in advance of the storm and sharply colder weather lurked behind it.
Federal and state officials have promised to do whatever is necessary to help Huntsville, even if disaster relief funds are squeezed by Hurricane Hugo and the quake.
