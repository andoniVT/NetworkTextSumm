The youngest victim, a 2{-year-old girl, died Friday after being taken off life-support systems.
Most of the dead were in apartments and stores that were torn into twisted wreckage, or in cars blown off the pavement.
The temperature, which had risen to 73 before the storm Wednesday, plunged into the 30s early Thursday while rescuers worked through the night under the glare of floodlights.
``It came in with a huge roar, an enormous amount of water, and it just started shaking and tearing at everything it could get hold of,'' said real estate broker Ike Carroll, who was in his car when the twister struck.
Cars were piled atop each other.
No houses were burned.
In Wyckoff, N.J., high winds knocked a power line onto a gas line, sparking a fire that forced the evacuation of 20 homes, according to police.
Authorities had said 19 people were killed but later lowered the death toll by two.
The other victim perished on the city's outskirts, authorities said.
Hunt assigned nearly 200 Guardsmen to assist in the cleanup and help law officers guard against looting.
The tornado seemed to catch everyone by surprise.
The lights, powered by generators, produced an eerie glow in a area that was otherwise largely without power.
