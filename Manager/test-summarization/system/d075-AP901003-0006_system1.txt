At the start of the study, their average cholesterol levels were 251.
Despite wide acceptance of cholesterol lowering, doubts remain about whether it actually helps people live longer if they already have healthy hearts.
During an average of 10 years of follow up, the death rate among surgery patients who had sustained minimal heart damage was 24 percent.
The study was conducted in Minneapolis, Los Angeles, Philadelphia and Little Rock, Ark., and published in today's New England Journal of Medicine.
