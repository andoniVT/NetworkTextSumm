At the start of the study, their average cholesterol levels were 251.
``It is a very powerful study and should, except for certain people who will never be satisfied, end the cholesterol controversy.''
``It offers the strongest justification for marked lipid (cholesterol) ineervention that has ever been offered,'' Buchwald said.
Although the latest study was conducted exclusively on people who had suffered heart attacks, Buchwald said he believes the research should settle that question.

The study was conducted in Minneapolis, Los Angeles, Philadelphia and Little Rock, Ark., and published in today's New England Journal of Medicine.
