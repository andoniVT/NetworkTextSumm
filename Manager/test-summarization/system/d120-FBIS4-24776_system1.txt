Work to seek a new leader will be conducted by veteran Tories; how can John Major be qualified for such a task?
Now, it is just a matter of time until he leaves office; but nobody will let him make arrangements for the transfer of power.
That would only aggravate the Tory's poor image as a party which enjoys little public support and has few talents.
That should have been a party secret; making public such an inside story would only provide evidence of political reality, namely, many Conservatives did not agree to Chris Patten contending for this position.
When the new party chairman is elected, the question of who will replace John Major will be settled too.
