The tornado seemed to catch everyone by surprise.
State Police and survivors said they believed the school was hit by a tornado, but the National Weather Service said it could not confirm that until investigators went to the scene.
The temperature, which had risen to 73 before the storm Wednesday, plunged into the 30s early Thursday while rescuers worked through the night under the glare of floodlights.
As the storm moved north on Thursday, it knocked over trees and ripped the the roofs off houses in West Virginia, injuring four members of one family, two seriously.
``You are talking about huge concrete blocks that fell on top of the kids,'' state police Lt. Robert Hughes said.
