``It's very similar to what we had in Armenia,'' he said of the Dec. 7, 1988, earthquake that killed about 25,000 people.
``Most casualties from earthquakes are caused by something falling on top of you,'' said Russ Needham, a geophysist with the U.S. Geological Survey that monitors ground motion around the world.
The quake hit at 12:30 a.m. in Iran, when most of the people were in their homes, Needham said Thursday in a telephone interview from Golden, Colo. At least 25,000 people died and thousands were injured in the quake, which demolished scores of villages and buried thousands of people in the rubble of their homes, Iranian officials said.
