Potential crop losses from the pests could hit 1 million tons, FAO said.
In the Sahel region of sub-Saharan Africa, however, locusts flourishing in unexpectedly heavy rains have damaged this year's harvest.
Grain production in South America should be slightly lower this year than last.
In Asia the yearly monsoon rains started on time, and production in Europe and the Soviet is expected to be larger than last year.
The agency projected good harvests in other parts of the world.
The most severely hit crops are coarse grains _ mostly maize, barley and oats, the report said.
It said the rising prices could also reduce food aid from developed countries.
