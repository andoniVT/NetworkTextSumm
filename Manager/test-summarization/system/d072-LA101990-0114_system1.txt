There is very little available on Bernstein in the home-video market, which is no surprise considering there are so few classical music titles on cassette.
The entire Bernstein catalogue encompasses well over 200 classical recordings and occupies more than a full page in the Schwann catalogue.
In Los Angeles, Carol Brown, West Coast manager of sales and marketing for BMG Classics/RCA Red Seal, told The Times on Thursday that her label now plans a March release of recordings by Bernstein conducting the RCA Symphony in Copland's "Billy the Kid" and a suite from Bernstein's "On the Town," recordings made in the 1940s, and representing the conductor/composer's first commercial recordings.
