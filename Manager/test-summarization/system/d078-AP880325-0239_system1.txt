Charlie Chaplin received one at the first Academy Awards for his creation of ``The Circus'' and again at the 44th awards for ``the incalculable effect he has had in making motion pictures the art form of this century.''
Spielberg's ``Empire of the Sun'' won six nominations this year, none of them major and none for director.
Since no movie has ever won a best picture Oscar without its director at least being nominated, the chances of the once-favored ``Broadcast News'' to be a big winner at the awards ceremony on April 11 have been significantly reduced.
Billy Wilder's classic comedy, ``Some Like It Hot,'' failed to be nominated as best picture, as did Chaplin's ``Modern Times,'' Hawks' ``Red River'' and Woody Allen's ``Manhattan.''
