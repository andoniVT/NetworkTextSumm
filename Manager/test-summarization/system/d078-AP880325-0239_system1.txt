Oscar might use Joe E. Brown's final line from ``Some Like It Hot'': ``Nobody's perfect.''

``How Green Was My Valley'' was named best picture.
The overlooking of classic films and the industry's most talented filmmakers has provided historians with cause for dispute.
Cary Grant once remarked that he never expected to win an Academy Award.
Charlie Chaplin received one at the first Academy Awards for his creation of ``The Circus'' and again at the 44th awards for ``the incalculable effect he has had in making motion pictures the art form of this century.''
