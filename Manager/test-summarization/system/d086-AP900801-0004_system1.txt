 Iraqi troops have launched an offensive against Kuwait, the Kuwaiti embassy said Wednesday night.
Earlier in the day, the Iraqi ambassador, Mohamed Al-Mashat, was summoned to the State Department afternoon for a meeting with Assistant Secretary John Kelly.
Iraq then claimed Kuwait as part of its territory, but the appearance on the Kuwaiti side of the border of troops from Britain and other Arab states deterred further action by Iraq.
The attack started about midnight, Kuwaiti time (5 p.m. EDT), Bader said.
Iraq threatened to invade once before, in 1961 after Britain ended its protectorate over Kuwait.
The United States, whose Persian Gulf naval patrols helped Iraq defeat Iran in the 1980-1988 war, has six warships in the area.
