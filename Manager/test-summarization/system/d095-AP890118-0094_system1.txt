 A South Carolina school where a gunman killed two 8-year-old girls Sept. 26 will send cards and offer words of encouragement to a California school that lost five pupils in a shooting rampage.
``Our wounds have not closed.
Children at the Greenwood school will be asked to send cards to the California school, while the principal, Eleanor Rice, and Ms. Finkbeiner said they will contact officials at the Stockton school to offer encouragement.
We are still hurting.
``I'm just in shock,'' she said.
It's unhappy, but they can live through it; they can be happy another day,'' Ms. Finkbeiner said.
I know we can help.''
