 Seven years late, the Hubble Space Telescope is where it belongs, out of this world and in search of others so distant that they may have been formed at the beginning of time.
``It's a beautiful day to have Hubble Space Telescope in orbit instead of here on Earth like it's been for so many years,'' said NASA administrator Richard Truly.
``Somebody the other day said, `Who remembers the day that Galileo picked up his telescope to look at the stars?'''
While it remained on Earth, the telescope cost $7 million a month to exercise and keep in readiness.
The Hubble is expected to help provide the answer to two major questions: How old is the universe?
