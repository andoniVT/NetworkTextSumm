They will further inspect the flood situation and extend sympathy and solicitude to flood victims there.
It has been learned that on 25 June Wen Jiabao and his party will visit other localities including Xingan, Fengcheng, and Jian where the flooding has been the most serious.
While carrying out flood-fighting and relief work, we should also continually and properly handle various tasks concerning reform, stability, and development in Jiangxi.
We should take measures to promptly salvage the early-ripening rice, and should expand the planting of late-ripening rice and autumn grain as much as possible so as to attain a bumper harvest of grain for the whole year.
