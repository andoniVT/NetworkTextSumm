Federal lawmaker Johannes Gerster said refusal to turn over the deposed East German leader for trial could ``burden'' Bonn and Moscow's ``outstanding relations,'' the Neue Osnabruecker Zeitung newspaper reported.
 A ranking member of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's party demanded the Soviet Union hand over Erich Honecker, who is wanted by German authorities on manslaughter charges, a newspaper reported on Saturday.
Soviet officials have said Honecker is staying at the hospital for humanitarian reasons, and German police need permission from the Soviets to gain entry.
A Berlin court has issued an arrest warrant for Honecker, 78, on the manslaughter charges.
He is accused of issuing shoot-to-kill orders to East German guards at the now-fallen Berlin Wall.
