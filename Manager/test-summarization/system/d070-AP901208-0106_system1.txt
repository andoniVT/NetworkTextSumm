Honecker's fate is one of the first issues facing Bonn and Moscow since they signed several treaties designed to draw the two nations closer together.
Soviet officials have said Honecker is staying at the hospital for humanitarian reasons, and German police need permission from the Soviets to gain entry.
He has taken refuge at a Soviet military hospital in Beelitz, outside Berlin.
Honecker has denied all charges against him, including that he was personally responsible for the estimated 200 people who died trying to escape his repressive government.
 A ranking member of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's party demanded the Soviet Union hand over Erich Honecker, who is wanted by German authorities on manslaughter charges, a newspaper reported on Saturday.
