The 1989 film, widely hailed by critics, received only two Academy Award nominations, and isn't being considered for best picture or best director.
 HOLLYWOOD (AP) _ Like all great contests, the annual Academy Awards ceremony has generated a wealth of statistics and trivia over its 60 years of existence, all carefully chronicled by Oscar historians.
Since no movie has ever won a best picture Oscar without its director at least being nominated, the chances of the once-favored ``Broadcast News'' to be a big winner at the awards ceremony on April 11 have been significantly reduced.
Oscar's 60-year history is filled with examples of the film world's highest achievers being overlooked by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.
The decision was a setback for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which had sued a Chicago-based manufacturer of an employee-incentive trophy similar to the Oscar.
Given the tremendous impact both an Oscar nomination and an Oscar victory have on a film's fortunes, it's not entirely surprising that a certain degree of artifice might surround the Oscars.
That "Who Framed Roger Rabbit" won three of the six awards for which it was nominated may save the academy some embarrassment for neglecting the one 1988 film sure to be regarded as a classic.
