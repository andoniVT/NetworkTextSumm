Since no movie has ever won a best picture Oscar without its director at least being nominated, the chances of the once-favored ``Broadcast News'' to be a big winner at the awards ceremony on April 11 have been significantly reduced.
 HOLLYWOOD (AP) _ Like all great contests, the annual Academy Awards ceremony has generated a wealth of statistics and trivia over its 60 years of existence, all carefully chronicled by Oscar historians.
Oscar's 60-year history is filled with examples of the film world's highest achievers being overlooked by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.
The 1989 film, widely hailed by critics, received only two Academy Award nominations, and isn't being considered for best picture or best director.
The Collector's Book Store, local sponsors of monthly entertainment memorabilia auctions, has sold off seven Oscars in the past year, including the best picture trophy for 1951's ``An American in Paris'' ($15,760), Marlon Brando's best actor prize for 1954's ``On the Waterfront'' ($13,000) and the black and white interior decoration Oscar for 1941's ``How Green Was My Valley'' ($17,715).
More than 4,600 members were given ballots this year for the 61st Annual Academy Awards, which will be telecast on March 29 from the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles.
