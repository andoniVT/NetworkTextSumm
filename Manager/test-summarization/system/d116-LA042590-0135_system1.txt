If there are no problems, Discovery will land at 6:49 a.m. PDT Sunday at Edwards Air Force Base.
After the telescope is released and functioning on its own, the Discovery will back off about 40 miles and shepherd the scope around Earth for two days.
The solar arrays keep the telescope's high-tech batteries charged, and if they are not fully deployed within six hours after the telescope is lifted out of the cargo bay, the batteries will have discharged to the point that some instruments in the telescope could be damaged.
The arm, however, tends to drift slightly, so he will have his hands full keeping the telescope from banging into the sides of the payload bay as he lifts it.
