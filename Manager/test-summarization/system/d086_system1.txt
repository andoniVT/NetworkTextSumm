 President Bush embargoed all trade with Iraq and froze the nation's assets in the United States on Thursday while refusing to rule out the use of U.S. troops to rescue Kuwait from its Iraqi invaders.
In a related development, the State Department confirmed that invading Iraqi troops had rounded up six American oil field workers near the border of Kuwait.
The United States contends that stiff sanctions by a united international front are necessary to punish Iraq and to force it to withdraw from Kuwait, which was invaded Thursday.
A second executive order signed by the President early Thursday froze Kuwait's assets in the United States, a step taken to prevent Iraq from seizing Kuwaiti property.
``Iraq has responded to the request from interim government of free Kuwait and decided to cooperate with it,'' the Iraqi statement said.
However, Iraq's ambassador to Washington, Mohammed al Mashat, said Iraq had invaded Kuwait in response to a request from the nation's "interim free government."
