Don Shinkle, Wal-Mart's director of corporate and public affairs, attributed Wal-Mart's success to its ``associates'' _ the term for employees first coined in 1972 to stress that all Wal-Mart employees are partners in the company _ and to Sam Walton's leadership and knack for hiring the ``right person at the right time.''
His company, Wal-Mart, made sales of Dollars 55bn last year, and after Walton's death Fortune magazine reported that his wife and four children held between them the second-largest fortune in the world - Dollars 23.5bn.
Walton, who prefers bird-hunting, tennis and opening new Wal-Mart stores to trumpeting his personal financial holdings, is again shunning publicity about his third consecutive ranking among the world's top billionaires.
Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s Visitors Center opens Wednesday in the same building on the downtown square where Walton first opened for business on May 9, 1950.
It was precisely such locations which became the bedrock of the business, though in the process Wal-Mart put out of business hundreds of small main street stores, prompting bitter resistance in some towns which Mr Walton tended to blunt with generous charitable donations.
Walton learned from them all, but was unique in taking his discount stores into small towns of a few thousand people, where shoppers used to travelling long distances were delighted to have a cut-price store nearby selling everything they needed.
