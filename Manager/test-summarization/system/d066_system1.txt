Although Walton built up a small chain of Ben Franklin variety store franchises from 1945, it was not until 1962 that he opened his first Wal-Mart discount store.
Mr Walton also disproved the conventional wisdom that large discount stores could not operate successfully in the small, rural towns of the US south.
Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s Visitors Center opens Wednesday in the same building on the downtown square where Walton first opened for business on May 9, 1950.
Walton learned from them all, but was unique in taking his discount stores into small towns of a few thousand people, where shoppers used to travelling long distances were delighted to have a cut-price store nearby selling everything they needed.
Walton, who prefers bird-hunting, tennis and opening new Wal-Mart stores to trumpeting his personal financial holdings, is again shunning publicity about his third consecutive ranking among the world's top billionaires.
Paying unexpected calls on stores is one way Walton has kept in close touch with everyday goings-on.
``I thought to myself this is absolutely the worst discount store, or retail store, I have ever seen,'' said Glass, who was president of a drugstore chain at the time.
Shinkle said Walton stays busy visiting many of the more than 1,400 stores operated by the company he started as a single five-and-dime at Rogers more than two decades ago.
