WAL-MART: A HISTORY OF SAM WALTONS RETAIL PHENOMENON by Sandra S. Vance and Roy V. Scott Twayne Publishers, New York, Dollars 14.95 240 pages Many people might be said to be the personification of the American Dream; few are better qualified for that title than Sam Walton.
What they found was a happily married, much-liked billionaire who enjoyed quail hunting, breakfasted at the local Holiday Inn, and drove a battered pick-up truck, minus two hub-caps.
Don Shinkle, Wal-Marts director of corporate and public affairs, attributed Wal-Marts success to its associates _ the term for employees first coined in 1972 to stress that all Wal-Mart employees are partners in the company _ and to Sam Waltons leadership and knack for hiring the right person at the right time.

Aside from the other displays and presentations, the center also has a replica of Sam Waltons original office at the store, including many fixtures he used 40 years ago.
Walton said he wanted to put in about a dozen stores and needed someone to tend the shop in Bentonville while he and his brother built a chain of Ben Franklins, Bogle said in a recent interview.
