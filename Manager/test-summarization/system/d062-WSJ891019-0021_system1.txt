The White House already is talking of Mr. Bush visiting the California earthquake site this weekend.
On his FEMA visit, Mr. Bush said that he hoped there would be "less carping" about the emergency office's performance this time, adding that the agency "took a hit" for its reaction to Hurricane Hugo.
Mr. Bush himself essentially acknowledged that he and his aides were trying to head off criticism.
By noon, Mr. Bush had taken two phone calls from Vice President Dan Quayle, who was in California; made a televised statement of concern; signed a disaster proclamation; received a written report from the Federal Emergency Management Agency; and visited FEMA headquarters.
