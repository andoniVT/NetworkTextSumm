``Not all guests are able to wash the dishes conscientiously,'' Sakharov replied.
His strong convictions even extend to his insistence that he do the dishes after meals, wrote the reporter who visited Sakharov at his apartment.
Moscow News said Sakharov was stubborn, unassuming, an undisputed member of his country's intelligentsia and a man with his own views on how to deal conscientiously with world affairs and the demands of this life.
It said one Soviet book accused the Sakharovs of living in ``oriental luxury'' and engaging in ``scandals between spouses.''
Much of the Moscow News article seemed designed to undo harm caused to the Sakharovs by previous press campaigns against them.
