Much of the Moscow News article seemed designed to undo harm caused to the Sakharovs by previous press campaigns against them.
It said their two-room home was always filled with people seeking Sakharov's aid, and that the words most often heard there are: ``Help me.''
The article makes a clear attempt to refute some of the past charges leveled at Sakharov and his wife, fellow dissident Yelena Bonner, by Soviet officials and the state-controlled media.
Those writings have not been published in the Soviet Union.
``In effect, sometimes Sakharov bitterly jokes that he'd like to return to Gorky for a few months to be able to work alone on scientific work,'' Moscow News said.
