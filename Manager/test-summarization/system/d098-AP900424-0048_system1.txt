NASA estimates it will cost $200 million a year to operate and maintain the telescope in space.
The European Space Agency contributed $250 million for 15 percent of the viewing time.
However, NASA said it will release its first image _ an open star cluster in the constellation Carina _ a week after launch.
Hubble is not expected to start providing scientific data by satellite for a month or more after liftoff.
