The two will also discuss Northern Ireland and "what to do with NATO," Clinton said.
Major said Clinton would visit Britain, and perhaps the Oxford University, Clinton's alma mater, during the June visit.
On Tuesday [1 March], the two leaders will begin their discussions on a wide range of issues including Russia, Bosnia, Northern Ireland and the world trade.
 Washington, February 28 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton, trying to brush aside recent differences with London, today stressed Washington's special transatlantic relationship with Britain.
Welcoming British Prime Minister John Major in Pittsburgh, where major's grandfather and father once lived, Clinton said at the airport, "We're working together today to respond to the terrible tragedy in Bosnia to try to bring an end to the killing and to bring peace and to keep that conflict from spreading."
