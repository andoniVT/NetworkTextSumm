Major said Clinton would visit Britain, and perhaps the Oxford University, Clinton's alma mater, during the June visit.
Clinton and major will meet again in June in Europe during the commemoration of the 50th anniversary of D-Day of the second world war.
The two will also discuss Northern Ireland and "what to do with NATO," Clinton said.
On Tuesday [1 March], the two leaders will begin their discussions on a wide range of issues including Russia, Bosnia, Northern Ireland and the world trade.
Major will spend a night at the White House, the first foreign head of state to have this honor since Clinton became President.
