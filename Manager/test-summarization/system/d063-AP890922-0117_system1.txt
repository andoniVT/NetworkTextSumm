Witnesses reported hearing the explosion two miles away.
One of the bands had just stopped playing on the parade ground, said a ministry spokesman, speaking anonymously in keeping with British custom.
Defense Secretary Tom King, inspecting the wreckage, said: ``It is not yet absolutely confirmed that it is a bomb, but all the evidence is quite clearly that this is an IRA atrocity.''
British military installations are a frequent bombing target of the Irish Republican Army in its campaign to rid Northern Ireland of British rule, but today's explosion in the coastal town 70 miles southeast of London was the worst IRA attack on the British mainland in more than seven years.
