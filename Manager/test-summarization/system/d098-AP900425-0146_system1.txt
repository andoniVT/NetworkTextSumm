When it is in orbit, it will receive electrical power for its six scientific instruments from two winglike solar arrays.
The 24,250-pound telescope is 43 feet long and 14 feet in diameter, about the size of a railroad tank car.
It is expected to provide clues to the age and size of the universe, and it may solve the mysteries of quasars, pulsars and black holes and even find stars with planets that could conceivably support life.
Hubble will allow astronomers to study stars and galaxies so distant their light has taken 14 billion years to reach Earth.
The Hubble telescope, delayed by technical problems and the 1986 Challenger accident, has waited seven years to take its place in space.
