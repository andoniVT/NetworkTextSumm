The event occurred a minute later as the shuttle slowly and carefully backed away.
``So we have good news,'' said Dave Drachlis, of the Hubble control center.
Controllers monitoring the telescope at Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland said Tuesday that no problems had been detected so far aboard Hubble, the most expensive and complex unmanned spacecraft ever built.
Cameras aboard Discovery showed the telescope, being held at the end of a 50-foot crane, reflecting sunlight from its silver surface and a turning Earth in the background.
The 24,250-pound telescope is 43 feet long and 14 feet in diameter, about the size of a railroad tank car.
