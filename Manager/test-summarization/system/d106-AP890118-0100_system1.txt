``All of them _ except Sisulu _ had not seen Nelson since 1986, and they were very excited at being able to spend time with him,'' Omar said.
The Prisons Service declined to confirm or deny the visit.
 Four imprisoned African National Congress leaders, convicted in 1964 with Nelson Mandela, were allowed to visit their ANC colleague at his isolated prison house, an activist said today.
The four men, all held at Pollsmoor Prison in Cape Town, were taken to nearby Victor Verster Prison on Dec. 23 and spent about six hours with Mandela, said Dullah Omar, an activist and family friend of the Mandelas.
