She also stayed on target to become the second woman to win four track and field gold medals in a single Olympics.
Griffith Joyner dashed to her second gold in 21.34 seconds, shattering the world mark she had set just 90 minutes earlier in her semifinal heat.

 Florence Griffith Joyner twice smashed a world record Thursday as she blazed to a gold medal in the 200-meter sprint.
In that race, she ran 21.56, eclipsing the 9-year-old mark of 21.71 set in 1979 by Marita Koch of East Germany and equaled three times since.
