They said 44 of the injured passengers were hospitalized, including four in critical condition.
The Sagar was en route from Dhaka to Barisal when about 50 pirates launched their attack near Chandpur, 34 miles southeast of Dhaka.
Two independent newspapers in Dhaka, Ittefaq and Sangbad, quoted survivors as saying the ferry went out of control while trying to negotiate a turn.
Police said six bodies were found in the hull of the ferry, the M.L.
They said about 100 people on the ferry's roof swam to safety but most of those in the hull were unable to save themselves.
The ferry that sank was carrying more than double its authorized capacity of 100 passengers, police said.
