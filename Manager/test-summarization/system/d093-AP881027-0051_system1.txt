 More than 100 people were feared drowned after an overcrowded ferry sank at a river junction in southern Bangladesh, police said today.
Fifteen bodies were recovered and 94 people were reported missing in the sinking Wednesday night where the Ilisha and Tetulia rivers meet and join the Meghna, police and a district administrator said.
Six passengers, including a pregnant woman, were thrown overboard and have not been found, Chandpur police said.
The ferry was traveling from Mehendiganj to the island town of Bhola, about 68 miles southeast of Dhaka, when it sank in 22 feet of water.
The pirates, who had boarded the ferry as passengers, opened fire and exploded bombs shortly before midnight Tuesday as people were bedding down for the night, Chandpur police said.
