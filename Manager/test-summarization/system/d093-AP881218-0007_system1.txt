The 183 passengers and four crew members ``enormously exceeded'' the ferry's capacity and the ship capsized Wednesday before it had sailed 200 yards, the report said.
The Ministry of Communications, which is responsible for inland water navigation, announced in August it had begun an investigation into the safety of China's river vessels to determine if standards should be tightened.
 An overloaded ferry taking schoolchildren on a field trip capsized and sank in southern China, killing 55 people and leaving seven missing, the China News Service said in a dispatch seen Sunday.
It said that by Friday, 125 survivors had been rescued, 55 bodies were found and seven people were missing.
