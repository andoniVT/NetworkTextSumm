The move followed the July 21 capsizing of a ferry on the Min River in Southwestern Sichuan province in which 133 people died, and the July 25 sinking of a passenger boat on the Yangtze River in which 71 people drowned.
The Ministry of Communications, which is responsible for inland water navigation, announced in August it had begun an investigation into the safety of China's river vessels to determine if standards should be tightened.
On September 22, another overloaded ferry sank in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region bordering Vietnam, leaving 61 people dead and one missing.
The news service said the passengers were 183 students and teachers from a high school and primary school in Qiongzhong County, who were going to take the ferry to visit a hydroelectric power station.
