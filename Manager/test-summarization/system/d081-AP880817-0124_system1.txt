One of the stoppages, at a steel mill near Krakow, was broken up by security forces.
That mine has also been the scene of unrest in recent months, where workers have demanded improved safety conditions.
Solidarity spokesmen said workers at the nearby Borynia mine staged a brief sympathy rally but went back to work Tuesday afternoon.
Kuron said mine management then locked out members of the afternoon shift to prevent them from joining the strike.
Solidarity leaders said the strike began Tuesday when overnight shift workers refused to take up their tools.
Eight years ago, a wave of mine strikes in Silesia ended with the signing at July Manifesto of the last of three agreements that established Solidarity across the nation.
