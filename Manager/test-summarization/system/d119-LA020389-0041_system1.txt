State Department officials said that they had expected Mexican leftists to register complaints about the appointment because of Negroponte's support of the Contras but that they are confident that Salinas' government will not object formally.
Mexico's leftist opposition party already has criticized the appointment, which has not been formally announced.
Negroponte, 49, will succeed Charles Pilliod, an Ohio industrialist.
Negroponte was most recently a deputy to Lt. Gen. Colin L. Powell, President Reagan's last national security adviser, and had been an aide to Henry A. Kissinger, then national security adviser to President Richard M. Nixon, during the Vietnam war in 1970-73.
