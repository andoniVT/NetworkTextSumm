Sakharov arrived in the United States on Sunday to visit relatives and receive medical treatment before going to Washington for a White House visit and a board meeting of the International Foundation for the Survival and Development of Humanity, of which he is a director.
Sakharov, wearing a blue beret and plaid scarf, made no statement as he left the reception and entered a waiting limousine.
The ceremony was closed to the media.
About 200 guests, including author Elie Wiesel, Brooklyn District Attorney Elizabeth Holtzman, designer Caroline Roehm and ABC television's Barbara Walters, attended the reception.
The human rights activist was banished in 1980 to the closed city for opposing the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan.
