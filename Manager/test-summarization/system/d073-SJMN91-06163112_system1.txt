; Mount Pinatubo is typical of hundreds of volcanoes that make up the "Ring of Fire" on the Pacific coasts of Asia and the Americas.
Until volcanologists' attention was drawn to it by a cluster of earthquakes beneath the volcano this spring, it had not been studied well.
; Even if the volcano does not erupt, the threat of eruption is likely to keep the base closed for weeks at least, Lipman said.
; More than 500 volcanoes have erupted in historical time, he noted.
; So far, the winds have blown ash away from the base.
; "In the worst case, a really big eruption, all of Clark Air Force Base could be covered" with glowing ash, Lipman said.
