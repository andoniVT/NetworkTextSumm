; More than 500 volcanoes have erupted in historical time, he noted.
; "No reputable scientist I know of" is drawing a connection between the two, Lipman said.
; Volcanologists know of no reason the volcano's activity could be linked to the volcano in Japan, which is of comparable size.
But it would take several weeks of declining quakes and sulfur emissions before scientists would be reasonably confident that the military could return to the base.
; Their predictions might be a false alarm -- the volcano may have done its worst already.
But winds of the summer monsoon weather pattern, expected to begin any day, would send ash directly toward the base.
