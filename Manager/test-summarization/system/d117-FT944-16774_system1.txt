'Kelman's novel is unlikely to come anywhere near that,' one bookseller said.
In spite of heavy publicity, the novels nominated have been selling 50 per cent less than last year's shortlist.
Most damaging of all was the verdict of the booksellers, who dismissed the shortlist as narcoleptic.
The Booker prize has, in its 26-year history, always provoked controversy.
One guest at the prize-giving dinner at London's Guildhall, Mr Salman Rushdie, who won the prize in 1981 with Midnight's Children, remarked: 'James Kelman is good, but not as good as he thinks he is.'
In his acceptance speech, Mr Kelman, perceived by some as a Scottish isolationist, anticipated the criticism, by declaring: 'My culture and my language have the right to exist.'
