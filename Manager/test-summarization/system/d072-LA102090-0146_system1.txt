Last Monday, KUSC-FM (91.5) devoted its entire day of live broadcasting, from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m., to performances -- as conductor and pianist -- and compositions of Bernstein, including an unusual recording from 1956 of him discussing Beethoven's Fifth Symphony.
"I was proud to be associated with him at the New York Philharmonic and the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra, both of which he considered family."
 In addition to the Leonard Bernstein tribute that is part of the Los Angeles Philharmonic program this weekend, other local orchestras are also planning special remembrances.
KKGO-FM (105.1) also devoted a considerable amount air time to Bernstein's work on Tuesday and Wednesday.
