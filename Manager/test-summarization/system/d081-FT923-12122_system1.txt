This has led to temporary lay-offs, which have hit miners' incomes and led to the present bout of unrest.
The industry is experiencing a coal glut with pit head, power station and export stocks amounting to some 12m tonnes, the equivalent of a month's output.
In contrast to the copper industry, which continues to show a profit, coal mining is running at a loss with subsidies stopped in March as the government moved to control the budget deficit.
Further increases could only come if the government eased prohibitive wage control taxes, thus providing a powerful precedent for wage demands by other groups.
