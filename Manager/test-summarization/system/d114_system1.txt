President Abdul Qayyum, speaking to a reporter who traveled to Pakistans Kashmir, said the people of his state also had been sheltering insurgents since India launched the military crackdown in its state of Jammu-Kashmir last month.
Meanwhile, the president of the Pakistan state of Kashmir said in an interview Saturday that Kashmiris there had begun smuggling arms across the border to Moslem insurgents fighting for independence from India.
Troops battled mobs of Moslem separatists in the Kashmir city of Srinagar over the weekend, and at least 21 people were killed and 100 wounded before the fighting subsided Sunday night, police said.
Official sources said Indian soldiers shot and killed 10 Moslem separatists Friday who were trying to slip into Pakistani-held territory of Kashmir.
On Friday, at least 200,000 people marched to the office of the United Nations Military Observers Group in Srinagar, demanding a plebiscite in Kashmir, police said.
We are neither fighting a war nor trying to suppress any popular movement, said Jagmohan, governor of Jammu-Kashmir, the only state in predominantly Hindu India with a Moslem majority.
Moslems blew up a truck carrying security forces Wednesday, killing three soldiers in the few hours the government relaxed a curfew designed to stop the Kashmiri separatist uprising, officials said.
