 Moslem militants killed five people who opposed their fight for independence from predominantly Hindu India and kidnapped a former legislator, officials said Saturday.
The secession movement has been simmering since 1947, when the state of Kashmir was divided between India and Moslem Pakistan.
The militants, led by the Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front, are demanding either independence for Jammu-Kashmir, the only Indian state dominated by Moslems.
At least 47 people have been killed in Jammu-Kashmir state since the beginning of the year in violence triggered by Moslem militants demanding independence or union with Islamic Pakistan.
The Kashmir official said the fighting erupted when the militants fired at Indian border guards after crossing over from Pakistan.
At least 233 people have been killed in Kashmir since Jan. 20 when the government launched a crackdown on increasing violence by Moslem separatists.
The two demonstrations at the cease-fire line were to express support for Moslem militants who are fighting for independence for the Moslem-dominated state from the predominantly Hindu India.
Meanwhile, the president of the Pakistan state of Kashmir said in an interview Saturday that Kashmiris there had begun smuggling arms across the border to Moslem insurgents fighting for independence from India.
In separate incidents, militants shot and killed a Moslem they said was a police informer and a Moslem died after he was caught in an exchange of fire between militants and security forces, officials said.
