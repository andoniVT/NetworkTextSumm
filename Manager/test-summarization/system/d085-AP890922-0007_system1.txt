The coastal area could expect hurricane force winds for 10 to 12 hours once the eye comes ashore, officials said.
North and South Carolina can expect tornadoes linked to Hugo for the next two days, according to the hurricane center.
Near its center, Hugo's muscle reached winds of 135 mph, up from 125 mph earlier in the day and 105 mph the day before.
Right now Hugo is shaping up to be one of our biggest relief operations of the decade.''
