If the atmospheric conditions in general allow this warm chimney to build to very high levels, 10-12 miles high, then you can have a severe hurricane.''

The storm surge _ a great dome of water that follows the eye of the hurricane across coastlines, bulldozing everything in its path _ accounts for nine out of 10 hurricane fatalities.

A 1900 hurricane is responsible for the worst natural disaster in U.S. history, however.
The others were the 1935 Labor Day hurricane and Hurricane Camille, which bulldozed the Mississippi Coast with 172 mph winds and a 28-foot wave in 1969, leaving $1.4 billion in damage and 256 dead.
