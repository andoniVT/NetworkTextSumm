If the atmospheric conditions in general allow this warm chimney to build to very high levels, 10-12 miles high, then you can have a severe hurricane.''
 With the winds of Hurricane Gilbert clocked at 175 miles per hour, U.S. weather officials called Gilbert the most intense hurricane ever recorded in the Western Hemisphere.
That storm hit Galveston, Texas, Sept. 8 and killed more than 6,000 people.
But because the circumference of a hurricane changes so often during its course, no records are kept on their overall size, said center meterologist Jesse Moore.
Hurricane Debby, which barely crossed the 74 mph threshold to hurricane strength before striking Mexico last month, was probably about half that size, Moore said.
