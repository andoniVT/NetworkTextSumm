The mission would be extended a day if the space walk became necessary.
The 12{-ton, 43-foot-long telescope, about the size of a bus, is named for astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, who died in 1953.
``I'm pretty relieved, I must say,'' said Al Boggess, Hubble project scientist at Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md.
Space shuttle Discovery trailed 57 miles behind the telescope and was to stay nearby until the Hubble's aperture door was opened, set for Friday morning.
In addition, one of four ``rate gyros,'' wheels whose spin maintains the telescope in a stable position, was disconnected by an automatic system for a reason engineers were unable to explain immediately.
