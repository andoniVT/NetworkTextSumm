The 12{-ton, 43-foot-long telescope, about the size of a bus, is named for astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, who died in 1953.
The mission would be extended a day if the space walk became necessary.
When the door covering the telescope aperture is opened, starlight will strike the telescope's finely polished 94.5-inch mirror for the first time.
Its five astronauts spent the day doing experiments and taking pictures of storms over Texas and other views of Earth from 380 miles up, the highest a shuttle has ever flown.
Space shuttle Discovery trailed 57 miles behind the telescope and was to stay nearby until the Hubble's aperture door was opened, set for Friday morning.
