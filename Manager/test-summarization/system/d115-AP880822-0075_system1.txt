A quake of magnitude 6 can cause severe damage in populated areas.
Every increase of one number means the ground motion is 10 times greater.
The Richter scale is a gauge of energy released by an earthquake, as measured by ground motion recorded on a seismograph.
Official accounts said more than 1,500 people died, but seismologists said their records showed 30,000 were killed.
It was the worst quake to strike the region in 38 years.
Officials said at least 45 people died, but it was not known whether the deaths were due to floods or collapsing houses.
More than 25,000 houses were flattened in Darbhanga, as well as the districts of Munger and Madhubani, Indian officials said.
