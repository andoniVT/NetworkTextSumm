The European Space Agency contributed $250 million to the Hubble project and will get to use the telescope 15 percent of the time.
``But those are very remote potentials I really suspect we won't encounter.''
The shuttle will follow Hubble from 40 miles away in case a problem develops and the telescope must be retrieved and returned to Earth.
Mission specialists Bruce McCandless II and Kathryn Sullivan, veteran spacewalkers, will leave the cabin to assist if necessary.
The telescope's aperture door will be opened on the next to allow the first starlight to strike the mirror.
Astronaut Steven A. Hawley will use the shuttle's mechanical arm to lift the 24,250-pound telescope into space on the second day of the mission.
