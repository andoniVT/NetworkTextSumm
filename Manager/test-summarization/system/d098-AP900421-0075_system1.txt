If the launch goes on schedule and all else goes well, the first picture from Hubble could be available next weekend.
The 88-pound unit was replaced with a new one, the first time NASA ever had installed such a unit at the launch pad.
``If everything goes well, it's going to knock our socks off,'' Chaisson said.
After the early test images are made and other preparatory work is done, Hubble is expected to start providing significant scientific data by satellite in a month or two.
Astronomers are counting on Hubble to unravel some of the mystery surrounding quasars, pulsars and black holes.
