Women are paid less than men and are poorly represented in management jobs and in Parliament.
Edwina Currie, a former junior health minister, said any other prime minister would have had several women in and out of the Cabinet.
``The critical mass of women have entered middle management in government and business,'' said Lesley Abdela, a founding member of the 300 Group.
One woman wrote to The Independent newspaper last week that her 7-year-old daughter wondered what title Mrs. Thatcher's successor would hold, since ``he couldn't be called prime minister, that's a girl's name.''
``It's Margaret's fault that the only people standing (to succeed her) wear trousers,'' Mrs. Currie said last week.
