``They were large, according to Mr. Butler,'' Vallecillo said.
 An Argentine supply ship that ran aground off Antarctica sank Tuesday in heavy seas and high winds, the government said, and there was concern oil in its hold could leak and damage the environment.
A Dutch navy aircraft and two life boats also rushed to the scene.
The ship sank at about 12:45 p.m. in high winds, some 28 nautical miles north of the island of Ameland.
Freight shipping in the area is also heavy because of its vicinity to the ports of Delfzijl in the Netherlands and Emden in West Germany.
 A freighter carrying a cargo of beer sank in the North Sea today off the Dutch coast and all nine crew members were rescued from life rafts, a coast guard spokesman said.
The nine crew members boarded two life rafts after the sinking in high winds.
Before the sinking, Argentine officials had discounted a spill.
The ship ran aground Saturday about two miles from Palmer Station, a U.S. research facility on the Antarctic Peninsula, the continent's tip.
But 104 crewmen remain at the station, said Renerie.
William Butler told Coast Guard officials their 40-foot pleasure boat Sibonay was attacked and sunk by ``several'' whales on June 15 about 1,200 miles southwest of Costa Rica.
