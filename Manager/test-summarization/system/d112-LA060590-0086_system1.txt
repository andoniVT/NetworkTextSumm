Maxwell, who publishes Britain's Daily Mirror, recently bought three U.S. supermarket tabloids, the Globe, National Examiner and the Sun, for an estimated $100 million.
Maxwell has already been in negotiations with USA Today officials about printing the paper for U.S. distribution.
Some analysts said it might make sense for Maxwell to try to purchase USA Today, since it would mesh well with his efforts to print and distribute his month-old "pan-European" English-language paper, The European, in this country.
The paper is conducting difficult labor contract negotiations with its unions.
The Daily News has one of the United States' largest circulations, but in recent years it has struggled to restore profitability and maintain circulation in a market with three other dailies.
