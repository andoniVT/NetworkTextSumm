After six months of followup, none had died, and the number of medical problems in both groups was similar.
However, the study in the New England Journal of Medicine said more research is needed before the findings are widely adopted.
Doctors from the University of Michigan Medical Center studied the effects of sending a few carefully selected heart patients home early.
Patients got out of shape, developed blood clots and became demoralized.
In the 1960s, the stay was shortened to three weeks and in the 1970s to two weeks.
The researchers estimated that if 15 percent of all heart attack patients were discharged after three days, the annual saving would be at least $280 million.
