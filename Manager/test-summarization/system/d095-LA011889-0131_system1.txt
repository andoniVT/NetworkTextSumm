 Patrick Edward Purdy, who turned a powerful assault rifle on a crowded school playground Tuesday, killing five children and wounding 29 more, had been a student at the school from kindergarten through third grade, officials said today.
Teachers said they did not know what to expect.
He transferred out in the third grade to a school in Sacramento.
Cleveland Elementary was in session today, although only a little more than 200 pupils -- roughly one-fourth of the student body -- showed up for classes.
Counselors were stationed in each classroom to help the children come to grips with the horror of the previous day.
