A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said U.S. officials objected to the five-year time limit before Germany could join NATO.
 The Soviet Union said today that a united Germany can join NATO after a five-year transition period during which all Soviet and U.S. troops would leave the country.
The official said the other Western ministers expressed the same reservations.
Shevardnadze, speaking earlier at a ceremony for the removal of the Western Allies' Checkpoint Charlie, said he wanted the Big Four Powers' troops out of ``greater Berlin'' within six months after unification.
Shevardnadze said the Soviet proposal seeks to limit the strength of the German armed forces and ``to revamp their structure to make sure that they are rendered incapable for offensive operations.''
