But according to Bush Administration sources, the Pentagon stepped up air patrols in the Persian Gulf and began moving warships, equipment and supplies into the area in a signal to Iraq that the United States would act to halt further aggression.
Before leaving the capital Thursday morning, Bush told reporters at the White House that he was "not contemplating" any U.S. military involvement.
"I think the U.S. intervention at this stage is both paramount and important."
At a joint news conference with British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who is scheduled to give a speech to the nonprofit Aspen Institute on Sunday, Bush said that Secretary of State James A. Baker III will discuss the Persian Gulf situation with Soviet officials in Moscow today.
