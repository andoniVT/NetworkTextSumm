Cabral said residents of the province of Barahona should closely follow Gilbert's movement.
 Hurricane Gilbert swept toward the Dominican Republic Sunday, and the Civil Defense alerted its heavily populated south coast to prepare for high winds, heavy rains and high seas.
The storm was approaching from the southeast with sustained winds of 75 mph gusting to 92 mph.
``There is no need for alarm,'' Civil Defense Director Eugenio Cabral said in a television alert shortly before midnight Saturday.
An estimated 100,000 people live in the province, including 70,000 in the city of Barahona, about 125 miles west of Santo Domingo.
Tropical Storm Gilbert formed in the eastern Caribbean and strengthened into a hurricane Saturday night.
