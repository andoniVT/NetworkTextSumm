But The New York Times reported Sunday that Navy teams who entered the turret immediately after the blast found the No.
 Navy investigators will be looking at all possibilities of human or mechanical error in their effort to determine what caused the explosion that killed 47 aboard the battleship USS Iowa, officials say.
The investigation team is headed by Rear Adm. Richard D. Milligan, former commanding officer of the battleship USS New Jersey, and it also includes experts on gunnery and weapons.
``They're looking at any evidence of human error or mechanical error, or anything technical,'' said Lt. Janet Mescus, a spokeswoman at the Navy's information center at Norfolk, Va., the ship's home port.
