The investigation team is headed by Rear Adm. Richard D. Milligan, former commanding officer of the battleship USS New Jersey, and it also includes experts on gunnery and weapons.
The Navy on Sunday released an amateur videotape of the explosion, which was made by an officer on the bridge of the Iowa who wanted to record the firing of the guns.
They said flame and hot gases from the blast went down the hoist to the lowest deck; if the transfer of powder to the guns had been complete, the hoist would have been sealed off.
But The New York Times reported Sunday that Navy teams who entered the turret immediately after the blast found the No.
