Within half an hour, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported that the tremor had been felt in Tehran, the capital.
An estimated 1 million Iranians were killed or wounded in the eight-year war with Iraq that ended in 1988.
While IRNA reported 10,000 dead late Thursday, the Iranian ambassador to the United Nations said 25,000 people had died.
In addition, the news agency's earliest reports dramatically underestimated the magnitude of the disaster.
 Iranian news media reacted with little emotion Thursday to a killer earthquake that left an estimated 25,000 people dead in northern Iran.
Roughly the same number died in a December, 1988, quake in nearby Soviet Armenia.
