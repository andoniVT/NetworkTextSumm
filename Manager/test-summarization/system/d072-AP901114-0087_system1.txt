Bernstein was the New York Philharmonic's 25-year-old assistant conductor on Nov. 14, 1943, when he filled in at the last minute for an ailing Bruno Walter.
The concert also included Schumann, Haydn and Mahler as well as excerpts from six Bernstein works.
Two pieces by Copland were played.
First chair musicians from the Boston Symphony, Israel Philharmonic, London Symphony, Santa Cecilia Orchestra and Vienna Philharmonic flew here, at their orchestras' expense, to take part.
Singers were the Westminster Choir, mezzo-sopranos Marilyn Horne and Christa Ludwig, soprano Clamma Dale, tenor Jerry Hadley and baritones Thomas Hampson and Chester Ludgin.
Cellist Mstislav Rostropovich played a Bach sarabande.
