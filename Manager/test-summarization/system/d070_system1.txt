82-year-old former security chief Erich Mielke shouted at Honecker, according to Bild newspaper.
 Ousted East German leader Erich Honecker will not stand trial in East Germany as long as the formerly Communist country exists, a West German newspaper reported.
 East Germany's deposed Communist leader Erich Honecker is too sick to be held in jail but is fit enough to be tried, the official news agency ADN reported Monday.
Lawyer Nicolas Becker, who had represented 81-year-old Honecker before the Berlin court in 1992 and early 1993, told DPA on Sunday afternoon that Honecker had rejected an operation.
Honecker, 78, was ousted as East Germany's leader on Oct. 18, paving the way for the country's first freely elected government in March.
Honecker, the aging hard-line Stalinist leader who ruled East Germany for 18 years until his ouster on Oct. 18, had previously been declared too ill to withstand imprisonment.
Honecker has denied all charges against him, including that he was personally responsible for the estimated 200 people who died trying to escape his repressive government.
On Sunday, West Germany's mass-circulation Bild newspaper said Honecker would be arrested but that he would be held at a prison hospital because of his condition.
