Earlier this month, East German prosecutors said Honecker and former state security chief Erich Mielke would be charged with treason and corruption charges for misuse of their positions and state funds.
Since Honecker was ousted Oct. 18, the former Communist Party leader and other party officials have come under investigation for charges of corruption and living in luxury at the cost of the state.
 Ousted East German leader Erich Honecker will not stand trial in East Germany as long as the formerly Communist country exists, a West German newspaper reported.
 Ousted East German leader Erich Honecker, who is expected to be indicted for high treason, was arrested Monday morning upon release from a hospital and taken to prison, the official news agency ADN said.
The attempts at suppression were engineered by Honecker and Mielke, bypassing the other 19 members of the ruling Politburo, Krenz insisted.
 A ranking member of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's party demanded the Soviet Union hand over Erich Honecker, who is wanted by German authorities on manslaughter charges, a newspaper reported on Saturday.
``All decisions and orders that led to the police actions against demonstrators and to their arrrest went exclusively through Honecker and Mielke.''
``Then-general secretary Erich Honecker and the internal security chief Erich Mielke immediately after each session of the Politburo consulted with each other on the security situation of the German Democratic Republic,'' Krenz said.
