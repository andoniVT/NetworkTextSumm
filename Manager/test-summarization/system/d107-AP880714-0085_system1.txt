 Weather forecasters today were offering drought-stricken farmers little prospect of relief in separate outlooks for the next 30 days and three months.
That was followed Wednesday by a 30-day forecast from the National Weather Service saying that drought-stricken areas from the Dakotas east to New York and from the Canadian border to Oklahoma, Arkansas and Tennessee are likely to continue to be short of rain.
The report noted that as of the end of June, 29 percent of the continental United States was experiencing severe or extreme drought, with parts of 35 states affected.
The Weather Service said normal temperatures are expected for the Atlantic states from Virginia south, and for the Gulf Coast states.
