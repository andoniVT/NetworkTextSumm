That puts the current drought on the same level as the one in 1911, but still less severe than the droughts of 1936, 1931, 1956 and 1934.
The report noted that as of the end of June, 29 percent of the continental United States was experiencing severe or extreme drought, with parts of 35 states affected.
The low 4 percent probability of an end within 3 months is based simply on a statistical analysis of past droughts, the agency said.
The separate drought impact assessment, issued by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Climate Office, points out that predicting an end to the drought is a complex thing, since dry spells have no normal lifetime.
