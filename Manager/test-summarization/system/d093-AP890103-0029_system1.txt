The Rufino Barrios Maritime Transport firm owns the ferry and operates two other ferries along the Livingston-Puerto Barrios route.
There are no roads to Livingston and most travel along the coast is by boat.
Navy patrol boats, fishing vessels and other private craft searched for the missing Monday.
No Americans were on board, he said.
Although seas were only 1-to-1{ feet, passengers were not used to traveling by sea, he said.
``It appears the boat rode a wave and that as it was leaning the people ran to one side out of fear,'' he said.
Officials had yet to determine the exact cause of the sinking, but Giron Arreola said the ferry captain was slow to respond to requests by the skipper of the naval patrol boat to take control of the ferry's wheel once it was under tow.
