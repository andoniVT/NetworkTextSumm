Mayor Steve Hettinger said the city would be able to withstand the tornado's financial impact.
Three churches, two schools, 35 businesses and 10 public buildings were either destroyed or suffered heavy damage.
The state will have to ante up 25 percent of the cost of providing clothing and temporary housing for tornado victims, with the federal government pitching in the other 75 percent.
Mrs. Quayle personally thanked workers cleaning up the debris left by Wednesday's twister and visited some of the injured at Crestwood Hospital during her 2{-hour tour.
He requested donations to agencies such as the American Red Cross, which set up a shelter for the homeless as rescue workers dug through the rubble in those desperate hours after the tornado struck.
