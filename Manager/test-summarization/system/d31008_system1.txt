Shepards friends call the attack a hate crime.
 Matthew Wayne Shepard, the gay student who was beaten in the dead of night, tied to a fence and left to die alone, was mourned at his funeral Friday by 1,000 people, including many who had never met him.

Shepard, a 21-year-old freshman at the University of Wyoming, had dreamed of working one day for human rights.
