Both were breathing with difficulty despite gas masks.
A rescue ship picked him up, he estimated, about a half hour to 45 minutes later.
``I was trying to get out of the way, but I got hit by the ship.''
``I looked around and I see this big hull coming at me and we were all yelling, but I guess the ship didn't see us,'' he said.
Clinging to a foam plastic float, he was passed by one rescue boat and hit by a second.
``The next thing I know, all I saw coming in was water,'' he said.
