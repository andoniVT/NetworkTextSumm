A rescue ship picked him up, he estimated, about a half hour to 45 minutes later.
The sailors were part of the multinational force arrayed against Iraq.
``I was trying to get out of the way, but I got hit by the ship.''
``And it was maybe two seconds, and the boat rolled right over.''
As Vickery was being treated for bleeding lungs caused by water inhalation, his hospital roommate, Seaman Michael Benjamin, 19, of San Antonio, Texas, was recovering from a neck injury suffered when a rescue boat hit him while he was in the water.
``I looked around and I see this big hull coming at me and we were all yelling, but I guess the ship didn't see us,'' he said.
