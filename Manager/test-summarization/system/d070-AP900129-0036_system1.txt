Earlier this month, East Germany's Luthern Church had offered to put Honecker up in a home for the aged upon his release from the hospital.
 Ousted East German leader Erich Honecker, who is expected to be indicted for high treason, was arrested Monday morning upon release from a hospital and taken to prison, the official news agency ADN said.
Honecker joins other members of his ousted Politburo already in prison awaiting trial.
The news agency said the 77-year-old Honecker was arrested after being released from East Berlin's Charite hospital, where he had undergone surgery for a malignant kidney tumor.
Honecker was immediately taken to East Berlin's Rummelsburg prison, the brief dispatch said.
