On Sunday, West Germany's mass-circulation Bild newspaper said Honecker would be arrested, but that he would be held at a prison hospital because of his condition.
Honecker, the aging hard-line Stalinist leader who ruled East Germany for 18 years until his ouster on Oct. 18, had previously been declared too ill to withstand imprisonment.
Earlier this month, East German prosecutors said Honecker and former state security chief Erich Mielke would be charged with treason and corruption charges for misuse of their positions and state funds.
 Ousted East German leader Erich Honecker, who is expected to be indicted for high treason, was arrested Monday morning upon release from a hospital and taken to prison, the official news agency ADN said.
