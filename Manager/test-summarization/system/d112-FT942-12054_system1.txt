Goldman said it had 'received no money or other benefit from these transactions other than its brokerage commissions of Pounds 110,000 which were substantially less than the amount of the applicable stamp duties paid to the Inland Revenue of Pounds 215,000'.
The trustees seek more than Dollars 100m for the sale of shares plus interest, commission charges and punitive damages from Goldman and Mr Eric Sheinberg, partner in charge of international equities trading.
The writs were filed late last week in the State Supreme Court in Manhattan by trustees for Mirror Group Newspapers Pension Scheme and Maxwell Communication Corpora-tion Works Pension Scheme.
