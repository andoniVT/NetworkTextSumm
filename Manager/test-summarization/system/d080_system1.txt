The McMartin case, which prompted the longest and most expensive criminal trial in U.S. history, ended Thursday with the acquittal of defendants Ray Buckey and Peggy McMartin Buckey on a total of 52 counts of child molestation at the Manhattan Beach school.
The jury on Thursday acquitted Raymond Buckey and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, of 52 child molestation counts and deadlocked on 13 other counts.
Seven jurors who spoke with reporters in a joint news conference after acquitting Raymond Buckey and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, on 52 molestation charges Thursday said they felt some children who testified may have been molested _ but not at the family-run McMartin Pre-School.
The jurors are deciding whether Raymond Buckey, 31, and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, 63, are guilty or innocent of charges they molested children at their family-owned McMartin Pre-School in Manhattan Beach.
