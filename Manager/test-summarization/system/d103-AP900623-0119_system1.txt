President Hosni Mubarak offered the aid ``in the framework of Egypt's concern to provide help for brothers and friends, especially at times of natural disasters.''
Thousands of residents in the predominantly Moslem Soviet republic of Azerbaijan, which borders Iran, donated tons of flour, rice and tea, and contributed more than $500,000 to a special earthquake fund, Tass said.
``The kingdom of Saudi Arabia ... declares its readiness to help in extending assistance to those harmed by the tragedy, wishing to help ease the pain of the afflicted from among the sons of the Iranian Moslem nation,'' it said.
The Vatican said in a statement that the donation of an unspecified amount was to ``provide for the most immediate needs of the population hurt by this huge earthquake.''
