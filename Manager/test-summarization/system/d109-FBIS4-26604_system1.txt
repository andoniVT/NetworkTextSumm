He urged local officials to be on constant alert against further possible floods and be meticulous about flood prevention and control measures, while doing their utmost to help flood victims, assisting them to resume production as soon as possible and maintaining social stability.
The governor warned that though the flood danger had receded, the determination to fight possible further floods could not slacken, as this is just the beginning: the main flood season, which usually begins in late July and early August, has not yet arrived.
The direct economic losses were set at 10.2 billion yuan.
According to him, 11 million people in the province's nine cities and 55 counties were affected, and more than 200 people died in the natural disaster, with 189,000 rooms destroyed and 1.2 million hectares of crops ruined.
