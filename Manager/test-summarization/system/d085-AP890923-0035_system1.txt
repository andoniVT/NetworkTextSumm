Gilbert seems to be about the upper limit of a hurricane with current ocean temperatures, said Kerry Emanuel of the meteorology department at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
That made it among the 12 strongest hurricanes this century to hit the United States, the National Hurricane Center's Miles Lawrence said today.
Hugo demonstrated the effect of warm Atlantic waters when its winds jumped from 105 mph to 135 mph as it passed over the Gulf Stream before hitting the East Coast, Schneider said.
Just before Hugo struck the U.S. coast, its pressure was measured at 940 millibars.
But if the seas warm up, say by 3 to 6 degrees Fahrenheit, ``the wind speeds might be 25 percent higher _ which means the destructive force would be more like 50 percent higher,'' he said.
