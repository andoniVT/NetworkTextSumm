Sakharov's widow Yelena Bonner, pleased authorities were not turning people away, praised them for being ``very democratic.''
Sakharov died Thursday alone in his study at the age of 68, apparently of a heart attack, ending a three-decade fight against the jailing of innocent people, for free emigration, for disarmament and other causes.
``I would not wish a living person _ he has lived an animated, happy life _ to be turned into an icon, an icon which could be used by various forces in their interests,'' Bonner said in an interview broadcast on Soviet TV.
Mourners carried small portraits of Sakharov and red and white carnations to place near his coffin.
