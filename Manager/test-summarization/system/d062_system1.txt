State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., the largest home and auto insurer in California, believes the losses from the earthquake could be somewhat less than the $475 million in damages it expects to pay out for claims resulting from Hurricane Hugo.
The earthquake's toll, including possible deep structural damage, goes far beyond the more easily observed damage from a hurricane, says George Reider, a vice president in Aetna Life & Casualty Insurance Co.'s claims division.
Insured homeowners without earthquake protection will get reimbursed only if their homes were ravaged by fire, which is covered under basic homeowner insurance polices, said Hugh Strawn, director of catastrophe services at the Property Loss Research Bureau in Schaumburg, Ill. Insurance companies attempted Wednesday to assess the amount of quake-related damages they're likely to have to pay.
Under a 1985 California law, insurers are required to offer earthquake insurance to homebuyers, but homebuyers are not required to buy the coverage.
 Most San Francisco-area homeowners may have to pay for damage from Tuesday's earthquake out of their own pockets, while insurance companies may reap long-term benefits from higher rates, industry spokesmen and analysts said Wednesday.
The Association of California Insurance Cos. in Sacramento said that in the San Francisco area roughly 25 to 30 percent of the homes have earthquake insurance.
