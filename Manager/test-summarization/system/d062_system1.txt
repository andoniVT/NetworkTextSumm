The governor's answer, which he has been repeating ever since the day of the quake, was that no one in Caltrans ever told him a freeway might collapse in an earthquake.
The governor is wrong, however, in his campaign to distance himself from the California Department of Transportation on the issue of what caused the Nimitz Freeway in Oakland to collapse, and what could or should have been done to have prevented it.
While Deukmejian is not necessarily blaming Caltrans, he seems to be preparing himself for such investigatory questions as: "What did you know and when did you know it?"
The major reason is so that California can learn from the experience as it designs new roads and reinforces existing ones against the next quake.
Deukmejian should be commended, as well, for advising state officials to do all they can to expedite aid to earthquake victims without getting too tangled up in red tape.
He was shocked that such a thing would happen.
The governor and Legislature should not wait too long to start the session, although they do not yet have precise damage estimates or know just how much the federal government will send to California.
Some adjusters, already in other parts of California, drove to the disaster area with recreational vehicles and mobile homes that could be used as makeshift claims-processing centers.
