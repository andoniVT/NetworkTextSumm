If the rebels succeed in capturing Kindu, 380 kilometers (235 miles) west of Goma, the rebel headquarters, this will remove the last government stronghold in eastern Congo and pave the way for rebel advance into the mineral-rich southwest.
 After a day of fighting, Congolese rebels said Sunday they had entered Kindu, the strategic town and airbase in eastern Congo used by the government to halt their advances.
Kabila has turned Kindu into a launching pad for a counteroffensive against rebel positions in eastern Congo.
The rebels targeted Kindu since late August, when they were forced to retreat their march from extreme western Congo to the outskirts of Kinshas
