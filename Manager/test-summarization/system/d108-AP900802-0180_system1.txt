The Soviets also condemned the invasion and stopped arms sales to Iraq.
CAUSE OF CONFLICT: President Saddam Hussein of Iraq accused Kuwait of stealing oil from its territory and forcing down oil prices through overproduction.
Kuwait, an oil-rich city-state, has 1.9 million residents _ 60 percent foreigners _ and an army of 20,300 soldiers.
THE FORCES: Iraq, a country of more than 17 million, has the Arab world's most battle-trained army, and had massed more than 100,000 soldiers on the Kuwaiti border.
Diplomatic sources estimate more than 200 Kuwaitis were killed or wounded, mainly from the Emiri Guard which bore the main brunt of the invasion.
