Early Friday, the invaders controlled Kuwait city, the capital.
The soldiers were also making sweeps through the southern oilfields, according to residents and Lloyds' insurance service in London.
 THE INVASION: Iraq's troops, led by about 350 tanks, crossed the border at dawn Thursday, and seized the Kuwaiti palace and government buildings 40 miles away.
Diplomatic sources estimate more than 200 Kuwaitis were killed or wounded, mainly from the Emiri Guard which bore the main brunt of the invasion.
Kuwait's Sheik Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah fled to safety in Saudi Arabia.
THE FORCES: Iraq, a country of more than 17 million, has the Arab world's most battle-trained army, and had massed more than 100,000 soldiers on the Kuwaiti border.
