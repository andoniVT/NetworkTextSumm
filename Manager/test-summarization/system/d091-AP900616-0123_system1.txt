``I looked up at a house on the hill, and it looked like it was on stilts on the water,'' Mrs. Schramm said.
When they returned, the basement and first floor were flooded, and the surrounding area ``looked like a big lake.''
Kathy Schramm, 37, said she, her husband and their two children fled their two-story house before water washed through.
James Boling of the Ohio National Guard said local authorities told him some of the bar patrons remained unaccounted for.
Mrs. Hulderman said firefighters rescued her husband at the mouth of the creek near the Ohio River.
``I began praying `God, don't let me die like this,' and the next thing I knew I was standing on my feet, and the water went down.''
