Outside, burned bodies lay among litter from shattered buildings.
Some victims were crushed in the stampede to escape.
At the 28-storey stock exchange building, about 3,000 people were on the second-storey trading floor when a bomb exploded in the underground car park, hurling shards of glass across the floor and into the street.
The bomb attacks were spread throughout the city and were clearly aimed at the city's better-off business people - in contrast to the riots in which victims were mainly poor.
However, Indian officials stopped short of directly accusing Pakistan, the country's arch-enemy.
The Indian High Commission in London said the attacks were 'part of the externally supported terrorism which has targeted India for some time'.
