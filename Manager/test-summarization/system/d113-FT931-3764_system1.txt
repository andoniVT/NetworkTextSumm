Mr Shankarrao Chavan, the federal home (interior) minister, told parliament in New Delhi: 'We suspect an international conspiracy.'
 THE INDIAN government flew federal paramilitary troops into Bombay last night after more than a dozen bombs exploded in the city, killing about 200 people and injuring more than a thousand.
Mr Sharad Pawar, the former federal defence minister just re-appointed chief minister of Maharashtra state, said all roads into Bombay had been blocked and the army put on alert.
However, Indian officials stopped short of directly accusing Pakistan, the country's arch-enemy.
All exploded within 90 minutes in the afternoon.
The identity of the bombers was unknown, but the attacks were a severe setback to India's attempts to heal the wounds created by recent intercommunal violence, which has caused deep shock throughout India.
