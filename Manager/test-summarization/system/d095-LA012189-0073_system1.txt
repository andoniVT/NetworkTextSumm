"The deaths of five children and the injury of 30 others, all victims of a wanton and senseless act by a person who had a criminal record, raises a number of questions," Deukmejian said in his letter to the attorney general.
Kevin Brett, the governor's press secretary, said in Sacramento that Deukmejian is seeking the information to help him assess various legislative proposals stemming from the shooting, including a proposed ban on the sale of military-style assault weapons, such as the AK-47 that Purdy used.
A spokesman for Van de Kamp said the attorney general will cooperate fully with the governor and provide him with whatever information he requests.
