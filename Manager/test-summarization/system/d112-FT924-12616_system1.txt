 THE LATE Mr Robert Maxwell liked to think of himself as a 'strong ' chess player and there was always a chess set in his suite in his London headquarters.
'There is no evidence to suggest that Maxwell actually was a strong player or that he played in any tournaments,' said Mr Malcolm Pein, international chess master and director of Chess and Bridge, which yesterday took over the business and assets of Maxwell Macmillan Chess and Bridge.
Even when the new company had reached agreement to buy the business from Price Waterhouse, administrator to the public Maxwell companies they then ran into trouble with Arthur Andersen, administrator to the private Maxwell businesses.
