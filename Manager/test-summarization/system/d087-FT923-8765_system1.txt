Morcelli has not been beaten in the 1,500m since 1990.
The Moroccan Rachid Al-Basir followed him down the straight, a respectful step behind, looming over his fellow Arab and glancing anxiously round like a bodyguard.
On Thursday night, Morcelli cruised through his heat in first place after the gentlest push on the accelerator.
Even here there is a US connection: Morcelli attended Riverside Community College in California, to hone his running on good tracks.
Morcelli is one of five Africans in the final striving to increase their continent's tally of just three Olympic medals (all Kenyan) in this event.
This is a man who derives immense pleasure from winning in front of a packed house.
