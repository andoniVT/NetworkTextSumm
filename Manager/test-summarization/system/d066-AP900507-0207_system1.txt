Sam's Wholesale Club closed out the year with 123 units and Wal-Mart announced plans to enter the California market.
At the start of 1990, Wal-Mart owned 1,402 stores, employed 272,000 and listed sales of $25.8 billion.
Don Shinkle, Wal-Mart's director of corporate and public affairs, attributed Wal-Mart's success to its ``associates'' _ the term for employees first coined in 1972 to stress that all Wal-Mart employees are partners in the company _ and to Sam Walton's leadership and knack for hiring the ``right person at the right time.''
And Wal-Mart Vice Chairman Donald Soderquist recalls that when Walton took his idea of putting discount stores in rural areas to Ben Franklin headquarters in Chicago, officials there ``just really didn't see a future in it.''
