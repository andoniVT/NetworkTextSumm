Astro will measure ultraviolet radiation undetected by Hubble and thus provide additional targets for the telescope.
During Hubble's 15-year journey through space, astronomers expect to look back to nearly the beginning of time and solve some of the universe's most perplexing mysteries.
Discovery's payload bay was sealed late Saturday night, drastically reducing the risk of contamination to the telescope's finely polished 94.5-inch mirror.
After that, all launch attempts must be halted for eight days so Hubble's batteries can be recharged.
NASA has until Saturday to get Discovery off the ground.
``In this particular case, everything's fitting together.''
``In some cases, it could be a problem'' having shuttles on both launch pads, Brand said.
