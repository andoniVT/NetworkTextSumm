 Saudi Arabia has been subdued in its reaction to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, which places Iraqi forces near the oil-rich kingdom's border.
The United States contends that stiff sanctions by a united international front are necessary to punish Iraq and to force it to withdraw from Kuwait, which was invaded Thursday.
The sanctions were intended to force Iraq to withdraw its troops from Kuwait and the resolution bans ``the import into their territories of all commodities and products originating in Iraq or Kuwait and exported there from after the date of this resolution.''
 The U.N. Security Council today swiftly condemned Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, demanding an unconditional withdrawal of Iraqi troops and calling for immediate negotiations between the countries.

The Saudis did condemn the invasion as part of a joint statement issued by the Gulf Cooperation Council, in which it is allied for economic and security cooperation with Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Oman and Bahrain.
``The United Nation's Security Council has condemned the invasion and the issue is now being discussed within the framework of the Arab League and we hope that it will issue a condemnation within the hour and that Arabs stand against this invasion,'' Kuwait's Awadi said.
