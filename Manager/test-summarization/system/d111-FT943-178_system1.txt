If the loss of a relatively modern passenger vessel in European waters can make shipping safety a higher priority for governments and the public, this will be some small compensation for the loss of life from the Estonia.
When a cargo vessel with a third-world crew goes down in a distant ocean, very little attention is paid.
But this figure pales into insignificance compared with the 96 general cargo ships and 12 tankers which also went down.
Five (small) ferries were lost last year, according to Lloyd's Register.
Ship safety is not, of course, just an issue for the ferry sector.
