Ship safety is not, of course, just an issue for the ferry sector.
These proposals were looked at by the British government in the wake of the sinking of the Herald of Free Enterprise.
Any review of ferry safety should focus on three main issues.
Five (small) ferries were lost last year, according to Lloyd's Register.
When a cargo vessel with a third-world crew goes down in a distant ocean, very little attention is paid.
Above all, if new regulation does turn out to be necessary, it must be introduced speedily.
The move to roll-on roll-off ferries with vehicle decks which run the entire length of the vessel has increased the risk that, once the sea penetrates the hold through the bow doors or a gash in the ship's side, it can lead to the vessel capsizing.
