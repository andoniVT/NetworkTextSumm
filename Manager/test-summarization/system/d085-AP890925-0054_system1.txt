Glen Ellis, a Red Cross official, estimated that 18,000 residents in Charleston and the three surrounding counties headed for shelters.
The last big storm to hit South Carolina was Hurricane David in 1979, which hit the coast after pounding southern Florida.
``We just feel very thankful about that,'' said Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. ``Several thousands of people who were in the shelters and the tens of thousands of people who evacuated inland were potential victims of injury and death.''
Tens of thousands more got into their cars and headed up Interstate 26 toward Columbia.
``We've had so many close calls,'' said Gary Garnet, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service.
