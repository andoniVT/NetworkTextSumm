Meanwhile, Garnet had some good news for storm-weary Charlestonians: late Saturday the tropics were quiet with no other storms brewing.
Mayor John Bourne of North Charleston, where there apparently were no storm-related deaths, credited people for heeding the warnings.
Tens of thousands more got into their cars and headed up Interstate 26 toward Columbia.
Glen Ellis, a Red Cross official, estimated that 18,000 residents in Charleston and the three surrounding counties headed for shelters.
Since then several big storms have threatened but veered away, and officials were worried that Charlestonians wouldn't heed Hugo's warnings.
The last big storm to hit South Carolina was Hurricane David in 1979, which hit the coast after pounding southern Florida.
