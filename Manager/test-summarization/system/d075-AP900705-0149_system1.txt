Jefferson Medical College, where the study was done, is part of Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia.
Lefer said his team is now conducting additional studies with TGF beta and that any experimental treatment of human heart attack victims with the substance is at least a year away.
Narrowed blood vessels carry less oxygen-rich blood to cells and this causes additional injury following a heart attack.
Lefer said the TGF beta seems to block the action of other substances, such as tumor necrosis factor, that can cause blood vessels to narrow following a heart attack.
Thus, by measuring for the loss of this substance, researchers could determine the amount of heart damage.
