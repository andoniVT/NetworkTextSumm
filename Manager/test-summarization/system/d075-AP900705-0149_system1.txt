There was about 50 percent less injury with TGF beta than without it.''
Lefer said his team is now conducting additional studies with TGF beta and that any experimental treatment of human heart attack victims with the substance is at least a year away.
In the other 12, they injected transforming growth factor beta.
 A natural substance called transforming growth factor beta appears to be able to limit damage to cardiac cells following a heart attack, according to a study published in the journal Science.
In a study at the Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia, a group of laboratory rats induced to have heart attacks suffered 50 percent less cell damage after injections of transforming growth factor beta than did rats that did not receive the TGF beta.
