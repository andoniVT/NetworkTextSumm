The deaths raise to 630 the number of people killed since security forces began a crackdown on the Moslem movement on Jan. 20.
The Kashmir valley, most of which falls in the Indian state of Jammu-Kashmir, is predominantly Moslem.

 The bodies of four Moslems were found in a Kashmir town Monday, five days after they were kidnapped by Moslem militants agitating for secession from India.
The bodies, which had bullet wounds, were found in the town of Sopore about 35 miles northwest of the Kashmir capital of Srinagar, said police officials speaking on condition of anonymity.
