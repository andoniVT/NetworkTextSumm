American experts from the Institute of Nautical Archaeology at Texas A & M University, working in cooperation with Turkish divers, have pioneered underwater excavation off the Turkish Aegean coast.
Nicolaides said he hoped it would be possible to tap American and Turkish expertise to excavate the wreck as an international project.
Papathanassopoulos said the 162-foot water depth at the site will make investigation difficult since underwater archaeology rarely is attempted at depths over 113 feet, but he said, ``This is a ship that must be explored.''
``This is a very significant, very emotive find, coming from this particular period of history,'' said George Papathanassopoulos, the Culture Ministry's adviser on marine archaeology.
