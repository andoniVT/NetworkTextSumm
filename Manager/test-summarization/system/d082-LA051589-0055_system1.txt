Sakharov was elected in April to the new Soviet Congress of People's Deputies, just two years after he was released from seven years of internal exile.
Speaking in Russian without notes, he said the new laws were supposed to take the place of measures used against dissidents like himself in the 1970s and 1980s.
He said the laws could restrict freedom of speech.
The physicist also attacked new legislation on personal responsibility now under consideration in Moscow.
Sakharov, who did not mention the name of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, described as "anti-democratic" some measures taken to quell nationalist unrest, particularly the toxic gas believed to have been used against demonstrators in Soviet Georgia earlier this year.
