Marcos has been living in Hawaii since he was toppled by the civilian-military revolt that swept Mrs. Aquino to power in February 1986.
But the government has not done so because of Mrs. Aquino's refusal to let Marcos enter the country.
 President Corazon Aquino has agreed to allow Ferdinand Marcos to return to the Philippines so that the government can try him on charges of stealing billions of dollars, newspapers said Saturday.
The Swiss government has frozen the assets of Marcos and his associates and has not released information on them to the Philippine government because of legal challenges posed by Marcos' lawyers and Swiss banks.
