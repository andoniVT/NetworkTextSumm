That creek never flooded.
Few people in the coal-mining and steel-making area carried flood insurance, and homeowners' insurance will not cover damage from Thursday's flood, residents and insurers said.
Authorities are not ruling out the possibility that other people not on the list could be missing.
Rainwater running down hillsides had forced debris into the creeks and formed dams at bridges spanning them, Shadyside Fire Chief Mark Badia said.
It was quiet and peaceful and people were looking to buy and build new homes out here.
 The death toll from last week's flash floods mounted to 21 today when a body was found in the Ohio River, and authorities said there was little hope for the 14 people still listed as missing.
