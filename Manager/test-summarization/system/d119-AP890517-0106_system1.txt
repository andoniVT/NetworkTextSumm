 The Senate Foreign Relations Committee today endorsed the nomination of Michigan Republican activist Peter F. Secchia as ambassador to Italy, but the panel's chairman said he feared Secchia might ``embarrass the United States'' because of his ``penchant for making gross remarks.''
At his confirmation hearing earlier this month, Secchia pledged to be far more careful as a diplomat in his use of colorful language than he had been in his different role as a political organizer and enthusiast.
The committee's vote was 13-0 in favor of Secchia, a former Republican national committeeman for Michigan and lumber industry executive.
``Mr. Secchia has demonstrated that he would bring opposite qualities to the position of ambassador to Italy.''
