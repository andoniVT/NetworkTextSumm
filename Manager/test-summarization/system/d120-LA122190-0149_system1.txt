Major, who arrived here Thursday night for a 40-hour visit, wasted no time in going on a rhetorical offensive against Hussein, using a succession of four television interviews aired shortly after dawn.
Comparing Major and Thatcher, one U.S. official said, "The biggest change is personal style."
Consistent with the U.S. view on the gulf, Major said: "There is nothing whatsoever to negotiate about."
"If he stays in Kuwait, in a country which essentially at the moment is rather like a prison camp, a country that he's dismantling day after day, then he will have to be forcibly removed," Major said.
On the gulf issue at least, Major's remarks augured well for his talks with President Bush late in the day at Camp David, the Maryland presidential retreat where the two leaders were planning an overnight stay.
