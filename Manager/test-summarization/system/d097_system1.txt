 This historic city has survived the ravages of earthquake, battle and storm in its storied 300-year-history, but it faced perhaps its greatest test of all in Hurricane Hugo.
The real forecasting problem with Hugo was predicting the intensity of the storm, which was upgraded to a Category 4 hurricane just hours before it slammed into Charleston.
But hurricane tracking remains an uncertain science.
But the worst natural disaster to beset the city occurred on the hot night of Aug. 31, 1886, when the ground rumbled in what some folks thought was a prelude to Judgement Day.
``It is very difficult to predict changes in intensity because we don't have very reliable computer models for that,'' McAdie said.
``We really need to improve on our forecasting ability of strength.''
Information from the satellite is used to improve the accuracy of the large-scale models that television viewers see every night.
Forecasters say the accuracy of satellite pictures is improving every year so long-range forecasting should become more precise.
The seaside community has suffered through many disasters, both natural and man-made.
``We had no radar or satellites then, so needless to say our forecasts were less accurate,'' Clark said.
Pinpointing the exact point of Hugo's landfall was difficult, but forecasters said Friday that the landfall was predicted in time for evacuation.
