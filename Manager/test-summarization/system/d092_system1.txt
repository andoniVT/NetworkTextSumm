 Iran said today that it would welcome relief offered by its bitter enemy, the United States, to help victims of the earthquake that has killed as many as 35,000 people, the State Department said in Washington.
Rescuers in Iran today freed thousands of people from buildings flattened by the earthquake in northern Iran, which struck early Thursday and had a magnitude between 7.3 and 7.7.
 Iran is deliberately underreporting the number of casualties from Thursday's massive earthquake out of fear of a political backlash, leaders of a group seeking to overthrow the country's Islamic leadership say.
The State Department said Friday that Iran was willing to accept earthquake relief from the American Red Cross and other U.S. humanitarian organizations.
 An anti-American newspaper in Iran said Sunday the United States is partly to blame for the death of tens of thousands of people in last week's earthquake.
