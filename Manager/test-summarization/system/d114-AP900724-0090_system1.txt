Hindus make up 82 percent of the population.
About 65 percent of Jammu-Kashmir's 6 million people are Moslems, making it India's only Moslem majority state.
The deaths brought the total number of people killed to at least 863 since Jan. 20, when the government launched a crackdown on the separatists.
At least five more Moslem separatists were killed in three separate incidents across Kashmir today.
Kashmiri separatists are fighting for independence of the Moslem dominated Jammu-Kashmir from the predominantly Hindu India.
Indian guards seized 22 AK-47 rifles, three machine guns and 1,425 rounds of ammunitions.
Pakistan denies it is training or helping the militants, but says it supports the separatism, terming it a fight for self determination.
