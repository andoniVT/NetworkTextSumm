We will definitely encounter more hardships and difficulties.
According to weather forecasts and meteorological reports, the province is expecting more rain to fall over the next few days.
At the moment, the province's flood situation remains very serious, because the water level is still high.
I would like to take this opportunity to extend my warm regards and thanks to the broad masses of Army personnel and people fighting in the front lines of the province's battle against the flood.
Will you please tell our audience something about the province's flood situation?
You have inspected some flood-stricken areas in Changsha City this morning.
