Governor Chen Bangzhu and vice Governor Zheng Peimin just arrived back in Changsha at about 0700 this morning after attending a Beijing meeting.
I interviewed Governor Chen Bangzhu here on the spot.
At the moment, the province's flood situation remains very serious, because the water level is still high.
I'm reporting in Changshanyuan at the eastern gate of Changsha City.
I would like to take this opportunity to extend my warm regards and thanks to the broad masses of Army personnel and people fighting in the front lines of the province's battle against the flood.
Under the current circumstances, the broad masses of Army personnel and people across the province should further step up their work and devote more energy to flood prevention and disaster relief work, this being an overriding task at the moment.
