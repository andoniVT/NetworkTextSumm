Nonetheless, Marcos supporters announced that they will march through the capital today to support the former president's demand that he be allowed to die in the Philippines.
Hospital officials there said that he rallied slightly Friday but remained in extremely critical condition.
Despite charges that Marcos and his inner circle looted the government treasury of billions of dollars, the former president still has a significant following here.
"I regret to inform Mrs. Marcos that as much as I agree that Mr. Marcos has his rights, I still have to consider also the rights and the interests of millions of Filipinos," Aquino told reporters at the presidential palace.
