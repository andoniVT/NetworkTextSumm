 Ronald I. Spiers, a veteran U.S. diplomat, will be the new undersecretary-general for General Assembly affairs, the top-ranking American post at the world body, U.N. officials said Tuesday.
He became charge d'affaires in London in 1974, and was minister of the U.S. Embassy there until 1977, when he was appointed ambassador to Turkey.
Spiers was ambassador to Pakistan from 1981-83 and has served as ambassador to the Bahamas and Turkey.
Spiers has been a member of the U.S. delegation to the United Nations; was director of political affairs for the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency; and was director of NATO Affairs for the State Department.
