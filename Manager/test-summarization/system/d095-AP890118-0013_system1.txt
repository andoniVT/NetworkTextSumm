State Division of Motor Vehicles records identify Purdy as 5-foot-11, 150 pounds, with blue eyes and blond hair, said spokesman Dave Davis.
His mother lives in Sacramento, Calif., and his father was killed in 1980 or 1981 when he was struck by a car as a pedestrian, Punzel said.
The aunt and uncle last heard from Purdy at Thanksgiving, when he was in Connecticut, Punzel said.
That job fell through and he went to Memphis, Tenn.
Punzel said Mrs. Michael told him Purdy left Oregon for a job as a boilermaker in Texas.
Neely said Purdy originally was from Stockton and that he had purchased the gun at the Sandy Trading Post Aug. 3.
