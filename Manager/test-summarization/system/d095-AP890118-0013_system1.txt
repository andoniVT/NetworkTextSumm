Purdy had no criminal record in Sandy, Clackamas County or Portland, authorities said.
Purdy, who went by the alias of Patrick West, had lived with an aunt and uncle in Sandy from the first of July until late October, said Sandy Police Chief Fred Punzel.
He later moved to Lodi, Calif., where he listed his mailing address under the name of his grandmother, Julia Chumbley, although he did not live with her, authorities said.
Her next-door neighbor, Pat Thomas, 45, said she met West when he lived with his relatives last summer.
Punzel said Mrs. Michael told him Purdy left Oregon for a job as a boilermaker in Texas.
