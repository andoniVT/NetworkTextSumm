 The shortlist of six for the Pounds 20,000 Booker Prize for fiction, announced yesterday, immediately prompted the question 'Who?'
Professor John Bayley, chairman of the Booker panel and husband of former Booker Prize winner Dame Iris Murdoch, expressed surprise at Mr Wood's failure to reveal his relationship with Ms Messud.
According to one insider, some on the list 'are B-team writers at best'.
But if the shortlist of the final six candidates for the prize may be disappointing, the traditional controversy surrounding the award is as rife as ever.
But it is the final list, rather than the controversy, that discredits the award according to some critics.
