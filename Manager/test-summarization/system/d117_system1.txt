The trust is a charity promoting reading and books and administers the prize.
``The prize has become internationally known, and the worldwide demand for the winning book, in English and translations, is spectacular,'' said Shaw.
The influence of the past on the living is a theme throughout the book.
Prof Bayley went on record with a rousing condemnation of contemporary fiction.
But if the shortlist of the final six candidates for the prize may be disappointing, the traditional controversy surrounding the award is as rife as ever.
'This list,' said one man of letters, 'must have dealt a final death blow to the Booker.'
Mr Kelman's book is, according to some observers, the most difficult work to have won the prize.
Her first novel, ``Shadow of a Sun,'' concerned the efforts of a woman to escape the shadow of her novelist father.
The novel, a story of Scottish low-life narrated largely in Glaswegian dialect, is unlikely to prove a popular choice with booksellers, who have damned all six books shortlisted for the prize as boring, elitist and - worst of all - unsaleable.
The prize was first awarded in 1969 after talks between Booker and the Publishers' Association on the need for a significant literary award to encourage and reward good writing.
