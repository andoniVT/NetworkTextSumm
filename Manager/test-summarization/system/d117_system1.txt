Six novels have been nominated for the Booker Prize, Britains most prestigious fiction award, and bookmakers say the favorite is The Remains of the Day by Japanese author Kazuo Ishiguro.
Carey called the award a great honor and he thanked the prize sponsors for provoking so much passionate discussion about literature _ perhaps there will be more tomorrow.
The Booker Prize is Britains literary event of the year, guaranteed to boost sales of the chosen novel after the award announcement Oct. 16, and dinner in Londons ancient Guildhall.
The Prize (courtesy of Booker plc, the food and agri-business group) is no longer the richest literary award but it guarantees great prestige, and sales, for the winner, and, say its admirers, helpfully brings The Novel to public attention.
This is the tale of a failed marriage, episodically told, and the black dogs of evil are both metaphorical and literal.
Television executive Sir Denis Forman, chairman of the judges panel, announced the prize at a banquet in Londons Elizabethan Guildhall, seat of the citys Lord Mayor.
One unsurprising omission from the final selection was When The World Was Steady, a first novel by Claire Messud, which was on the long list before it was pointed out that the author was the wife of James Wood, chief literary reviewer of The Guardian newspaper and a Booker judge.
