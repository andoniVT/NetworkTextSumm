The prize was first awarded in 1969 after talks between Booker and the Publishers' Association on the need for a significant literary award to encourage and reward good writing.
This week the shortlist for the hypothetical 1894 Booker Prize will be announced by six judges, including biographer Victoria Glendinning and broadcaster Melvyn Bragg.
They have avoided dull and worthy classics and chosen six books which stirred the fin de siecle world and remain compelling today: George du Maurier's Trilby, Anthony Hope's The Prisoner of Zenda, George Moore's Esther Waters, Kipling's Jungle Book, George Gissing's In the Year of Jubilee and RL Stevenson's The Ebb Tide.
 It is a sensational shortlist: a bestseller about love and hypnotism, a blockbuster about battles and brides in Ruritania, and a pornographic shocker about teenage sex and baby murder so explicit that only an obscure Newcastle publisher would risk printing it.
