America has the Pulitzer Prize for fiction and the National Book Awards, but in terms of excitement, hoopla and man-on-the-street interest, there's nothing akin to the 15,000-pound ($26,000) Booker Prize.
All the 1894 Booker writers were popular names; they were also serious, skilful writers whose books can be reread with pleasure 100 years later.
This year's six nominees were chosen Thursday from 102 books considered by a panel headed by David Lodge, a British literary critic and novelist who was nominated for the prize last year for his book, ``Nice Work.''
 Japanese writer Kazuo Ishiguro won the 1989 Booker Prize, Britain's top literary award, for his novel ``The Remains of the Day,'' judges announced Thursday.
 THE annual Booker ballyhoo got going again yesterday when the judges for this year's Pounds 20,000 prize for British (and Commonwealth) fiction announced the shortlist.
Other finalists this year were 1979 Booker Prize winner Penelope Fitzgerald with ``The Gate of Angels,'' Irish novelist John McGahern's ``Amongst Women,'' Canadian-born Mordecai Richler's ``Solomon Gursky Was Here,'' Brian Moore's ``Lies of Silence,'' and Beryl Bainbridge's ``An Awfully Big Adventure.''
 Six novels have been nominated for the Booker Prize, Britain's most prestigious fiction award, and bookmakers say the favorite is ``The Remains of the Day'' by Japanese author Kazuo Ishiguro.
