 Japanese writer Kazuo Ishiguro won the 1989 Booker Prize, Britain's top literary award, for his novel ``The Remains of the Day,'' judges announced Thursday.
The Booker Prize is sponsored by Booker, an international food and agriculture business, and administered by The Book Trust.
This year's six nominees were chosen Thursday from 102 books considered by a panel headed by David Lodge, a British literary critic and novelist who was nominated for the prize last year for his book, ``Nice Work.''
 Six novels have been nominated for the Booker Prize, Britain's most prestigious fiction award, and bookmakers say the favorite is ``The Remains of the Day'' by Japanese author Kazuo Ishiguro.
America has the Pulitzer Prize for fiction and the National Book Awards, but in terms of excitement, hoopla and man-on-the-street interest, there's nothing akin to the 15,000-pound ($26,000) Booker Prize.
All the 1894 Booker writers were popular names; they were also serious, skilful writers whose books can be reread with pleasure 100 years later.
Last year the prize was won by Ben Okri, for his book The Famished Road.
It is administered by Book Trust, an educational charity promoting books, and is sponsored by Booker, an international food and farming business.
