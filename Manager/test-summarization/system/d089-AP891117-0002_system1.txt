 Federal aid was approved Friday for tornado-ravaged Huntsville, where 17 died and several hundred were injured or lost their homes, and Gov.
``To look at that building, it's hard to understand why more people were not killed,'' Hunt said.
State emergency management officials estimated the damage in excess of $100 million in the agency's letter to President Bush requesting a disaster declaration, said Terry Abbott, the governor's press secretary.
Hunt asked that flags around the state be lowered to half-staff through Tuesday in memory of the victims, and Marilyn Quayle, wife of the vice president, planned to visit the battered city Saturday.
