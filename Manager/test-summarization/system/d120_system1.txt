 John Major, who was endorsed by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher as her successor and heir, was elected today as leader of the Conservative Party and will become prime minister.
 John Major, endorsed by Margaret Thatcher as the politician closest to her heart, was elected by the Conservative Party Tuesday night to succeed her as prime minister.
TORY ELECTION RESULTS Despite being two votes short of a majority, John Major was elected leader of the ruling Conservative Party after his challengers conceded defeat.
The prime minister had picked Major from among "backbenchers" -- those who are not party leaders -- as someone to watch several years ago and regarded him, aides said, as "a man of the people."
