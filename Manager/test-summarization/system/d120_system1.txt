"It is a very exciting thing to become leader of the Conservative Party, and particularly exciting, I think, to follow one of the most remarkable leaders the Conservative Party has ever had," Major said.
TORY ELECTION RESULTS Despite being two votes short of a majority, John Major was elected leader of the ruling Conservative Party after his challengers conceded defeat.
The results of the local elections showed that the Tories were reduced to the third party nationally, behind the Liberal Democrats and the Labour Party.
``It is a very exciting thing to become leader of the Conservative Party, and particularly exciting, I think, to follow one of the most remarkable leaders the Conservative Party has ever had,'' Major said.
 John Major, who was endorsed by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher as her successor and heir, was elected today as leader of the Conservative Party and will become prime minister.
Hurd said the party needed to unite, and ``John Major is the right leader for this task.''
``John Major is a Thatcherette - that is how he sought election and that is how he got elected,'' said Labor Party leader Neil Kinnock.
Major's victory ended a patient, four-year campaign by Heseltine to promote himself as a future leader of the party.
