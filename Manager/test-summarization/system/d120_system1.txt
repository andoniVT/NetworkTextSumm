 ONE year ago tomorrow, Mr John Major surprised everyone but himself by winning the general election.
Major, 47, her chancellor of the Exchequer, is the youngest person to be elected Britain's prime minister since the 19th Century.
He called Thatcher "a very great prime minister indeed."
Hurd also quickly conceded.
Aides said Thatcher is "thrilled."
Mr Major's anniversary inevitably led yesterday to an outbreak of political point-scoring over the government's record.
The past 12 months have been hijacked by internal party differences over Europe, by the debacle surrounding UK withdrawal from the exchange rates mechanism of the European Monetary System, and by a continuing, deep recession which has disappointed and alienated many traditional Tory supporters in business.
Major fell two votes short of the needed majority, but his opponents conceded defeat and Conservative Party officials declared him elected.
The government's efforts to secure a framework for long-term prosperity was beginning to pay off.
Most industrialists, however, find it hard to criticise Mr Major as an individual, with many drawing a flattering parallel between his personal qualities and those of his predecessor.
