Work to seek a new leader will be conducted by veteran Tories; how can John Major be qualified for such a task?
The Conservatives' choice of Major, a Thatcher protege, came after a battle pitting him against two other contenders for the party leadership, former Defense Secretary Michael Heseltine and Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd.
We are going to unite totally and absolutely and we're going to win the next general election," said Major, who emerged smiling from his residence at 11 Downing St. Major won 185 votes, former Defense Secretary Michael Heseltine had 131 votes and Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd had 56 votes in a secret ballot election among Tory members of Parliament.
He promised to reduce public expenditure, but on the contrary, it rose by 45.5 percent.
For a long time, John Major has failed to resolve the economic crisis and has seriously jeopardized the interests of British people, who have become poorer with each passing day and suffer from a high rate of unemployment.
But they are calculating that Michael Portillo will run hard to secure Eurosceptic policies from the eventual winner.
John Major has always been weak and powerless, and vacillates to the left and to the right resulting in his own "crisis of honor."
