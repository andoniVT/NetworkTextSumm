 The 29-storey Jijobhoy Towers, home of the Bombay Stock Exchange, was rocked by two powerful bombs last Friday, leaving 60 dead and 200 injured.
At the 28-storey stock exchange building, about 3,000 people were on the second-storey trading floor when a bomb exploded in the underground car park, hurling shards of glass across the floor and into the street.
The identity of the bombers was unknown but the explosion comes just five days after over 250 people were killed and at least 1,200 injured in a series of bomb attacks aimed at the heart of the Indian business capital of Bombay.
