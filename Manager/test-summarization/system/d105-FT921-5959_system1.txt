Armenians in the enclave want unification with Armenia, but Azerbaijan will not give up any territory.
Commanders of the Trans-Caucasus military district, which encompasses Georgia as well as Armenia and Azerbaijan, have been ordered to rebuff attacks on military installations.
Troops under fire along the Armenian-Azerbaijani border will also be withdrawn.
No dates have been given for the withdrawal.
Marshal Shaposhnikov, who is also commander-in-chief, has long warned that he would withdraw troops rather than allow them to become targets of ethnic conflicts in the former Soviet Union.
The order for the pull-out of the 366th motorised regiment follows the deaths earlier this week of a handful of soldiers caught in the fighting between Armenian guerrillas and Azerbaijani forces.
