Polls show the Tories would do better in the next national elections with someone other than Thatcher leading them.
But elections don't have to be called until mid-1992; Thatcher's public standing could conceivably increase by then.
Other candidates could choose to stand against her, perhaps diluting the opposition vote and letting her claim the simple majority she needs to stay as party head.
Memory and feelings being what they are, it is the mistakes and irritations of this long tenure that are more likely to be immediately recalled, while its achievements are left to history to salute.
 Embattled Margaret Thatcher remains leader of Britain's Conservative Party, and so the country's prime minister -- but only barely.
