He added, ``We have to be careful that we don't fall back into the kind of system that existed before the Second World War, a Europe filled with nations that were suffering various grievances, rivalries, disputed frontiers, driven by what they considered to be legitimate reasons but pitted against each other _ the sort of things that gave rise to Hitler in 1933.''
German reunification, said Craig, gives the world the chance to build a new international system, one that ``will prevent the use of international violence.''
For all that, Breitman said, ``One Germany is not only inevitable, but given the successful record of West Germany over the last 40 years, my feeling is it is better than having a regime in chaos.''
