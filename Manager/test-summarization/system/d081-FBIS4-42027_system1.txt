A rally consisting of 350 miners was held on 28 June near the town council building where demands were made to pay the wages and dismiss the director general of the "Ordzhonikidzevuhillya" production association.
In the opinion of the mine's representatives, who wished not to be identified, the strike has a clear political hue -- to attempt to compromise the existing authorities and, particularly, President Leonid Kravchuk before the second round of presidential elections.
The strike continued at these mines on 28 June.
After a meeting with the mine's director, who promised to pay the arrears, the miners on the third shift returned to work.
