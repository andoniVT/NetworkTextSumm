Last Saturday, in the Olympic stadium, I watched the final moments and aftermath of the women's marathon, begun at the same time of day and run in similar conditions.
He starts training three months before an event by running 80 miles a week and then building progressively.
Towards the marathon's end, however, radiant heat thrown off by buildings could be subjecting the runners to a temperature of up to 30`C.
It is estimated that when the race begins in Mataro, a seaside town north of Barcelona, the temperature will be an already-uncomfortable 25`C.
He agrees that the run will be highly demanding, and while he regards Olympic marathon running as a pinnacle of his career, he is cautious about tomorrow's slog.
