It said its troops _ no numbers were given _ were in Kuwait to defend the revolution and the Kuwaiti people.
The invasion came a day after talks between Kuwait and Iraq collapsed in Jiddah, Saudi Arabia.
Kuwaiti forces had engaged the Iraqi invaders with heavy artillery in their failed attempt to repulse them, Kuwaiti officials said earlier.
``You can see black smoke over there .... No one dares to go out.
The invaders were led by the elite Republican Guard that did the brunt of the fighting in the 1980-88 war with Iran.
Iraq, the world's second-largest oil producer, had demanded higher oil prices at last month's OPEC oil cartel meeting in Geneva.
