Last year's San Francisco-Cincinnati Super Bowl, won by the 49ers 20-16, got a 43.5 rating and was seen in 39.3 million homes, according to Nielsen estimates.
Viewership of the 5 p.m. game this year peaked at a 41.6 rating and a 69 share from 6 p.m. to 6:30 p.m., dropping off as it became clear that Denver would not rally.
``It's still a remarkable rating for prime time.''
The game on CBS averaged a 39.0 rating and a 63 share, the lowest Super Bowl rating since 1969, when the New York Jets' 16-7 victory over Baltimore got a 36.0 on NBC for the worst rating ever, A.C. Nielsen Co. said today.
