The documentary says the decision not to prosecute Hirohito came from President Harry S. Truman and that Tojo's evidence was altered so the emperor would not be incriminated.
Behr told The Associated Press in a telephone interview Wednesday that the documentary will be shown in the United States by PBS on March 13.
Gen. Douglas MacArthur, commander of the U.S. forces occupying Japan, wrote in his book ``Reminiscences'' that he fended off pressure from Britain and the Soviet Union to indict Hirohito, arguing that would touch off a guerrilla war.
It has been reported previously that American prosecutors wanted to keep Hirohito out of the war crimes trial and asked Tojo to suggest the emperor had consented reluctantly to the war on the advice of the High Command.
