The same storm system caused tornadoes in seven states in the South and Midwest on Wednesday, and was blamed for 17 deaths in Huntsville, Ala.
The storm was particularly violent because it occurred along a line of extreme variations in temperature.
Cold weather was expected to invade the Southeast, with warnings of freezing overnight temperatures posted for Friday morning in Georgia, Alabama, northwest Florida, most of Mississippi and all but extreme southeast Louisiana.
Seven children died when a wall collapsed in a school cafeteria near Newburgh, N.Y. Tornadoes were reported in New Jersey, Delaware, Virginia and New York, although the National Weather Service was unable to confirm them.
