I was in a trailer just outside the stadium, about to watch the telecast when the earthquake hit.
Those who were sitting in the upper deck seemed considerably more shaken than those in the lower levels.
And anyone who was at Candlestick Park Tuesday night for Game 3 of the World Series will never forget.
Most people stayed in their seats, waiting to hear whether the game would be postponed.
My immediate reaction was that a jet was flying very low overhead, but soon I knew what was happening.
 There are events one never forgets.
A few people were running out of the stadium, but there did not seem to be great alarm, because the quake did not last long.
