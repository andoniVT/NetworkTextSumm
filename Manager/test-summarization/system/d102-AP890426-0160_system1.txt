But I'm sure that feeling is shared by many people around the world,'' said Nelson Garifi, organizer of a homecoming for Miss Ball that was to have been held next month.
Goodell said that when the group was formed about a year ago, ``We sent an invitation to Lucille Ball to be a member, and she sent back a check for $500 for a life membership.''
The American Heart Association's Jamestown office was deluged with calls from Miss Ball's fans who wanted to make a memorial donation, officials said.
Mrs. Lopus said Miss Ball dreamed of fame, either as a dramatic actress in New York City or as a dancing girl in musicals.
