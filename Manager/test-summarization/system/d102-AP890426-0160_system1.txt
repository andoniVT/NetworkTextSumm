Goodell said that when the group was formed about a year ago, ``We sent an invitation to Lucille Ball to be a member, and she sent back a check for $500 for a life membership.''
The honorary degree will be awarded posthumously, said Garifi, who is community relations director at the college.
Miss Ball was to have received an honorary degree from the college at the homecoming scheduled for May 20.
In high school, she starred in high school plays and made her first appearance before a large audience at the now-defunct Palace Theater here.
Miss Ball was born Aug. 6, 1911, in this city of 40,000 people about 60 miles south of Buffalo, the daughter of an electrician and a concert pianist.
