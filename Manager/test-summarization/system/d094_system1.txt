The government said it sent its sympathy for the loss that has befallen the Japanese people, without mentioning the name of Hirohito, branded a war criminal by survivors of the wartime occupation of the colony that became Indonesia in 1949.
The Imperial Household Agency, which ran his affairs, said Hirohito considered the postwar period one of the most fulfilling times of his life, in which the nation made a phenomenal recovery from a war that cost 3.1 million Japanese lives.
There was no official comment from the nationalist Chinese government because of the lack of diplomatic relations between Taiwan and Japan, but the mass circulation Chinese daily United Evening News said: Asian people who suffered from the slavery and invasion of Japans militarists during World War II may bury their animosity with Hirohitos death.
The British Broadcasting Corp. documentary, details of which were released Wednesday by its maker Edward Behr, said the U.S. prosecutors worked with the emperors aides to find a way to avoid putting Hirohito on trial.
World leaders sent Japan messages of condolences and some declared states of mourning after Emperor Hirohitos death Saturday, but painful memories of World War II still generated criticism of the Japanese monarch.
