In Britain, Prince Andrew became the Duke of York upon his marriage in 1986.
The obituary issued in English by the Foreign Press Center, which is supported by the Foreign Ministry, was headed ``His late Majesty The Emperor Hirohito.''
But for the convenience of the rest of the world, which is not so able to keep track of the person behind the changed name, even official agencies have used the name Hirohito in English-language publications.
In Japan, years are numbered according to the emperor's tenure on the throne.
The Japanese custom of changing imperial names is not unique among world royalty, where an individual may have a variety of names and titles in a royal career.
