Iran, at odds with the United States since the 1979 seizure of hostages at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, has said it would welcome relief from the American Red Cross and other U.S. humanitarian groups.
``If the United States has real humanitarian objectives and intended to help the Iranian nation, it should do only one thing, stop hatching plots,'' the newspaper said.
``Even after its expulsion from Iran, the U.S. government by imposing economic sanctions and launching several other plots, halted the renovation of the country,'' the editorial added.
It argued that by ``plundering Iran's oil and other resources'' for 25 years, the United States had prevented the use of even a small part of the national wealth for urban development projects and ``advanced (anti-seismic) building construction systems.''
