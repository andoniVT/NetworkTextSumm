East Germany's democratic government has changed its mind several times on whether to pursue charges against the aging members of the former hard-line regime that was toppled in last autumn's pro-democracy protests.
Mielke was ordered jailed.
Last month, a medical panel ruled that Honecker was too ill to be jailed pending investigation but fit enough to be prosecuted.
He is staying in a Soviet hospital outside Berlin.
The murder charge could put Honecker behind bars for life, but his poor health makes prosecution questionable.
Honecker, 77 and in failing health, and several other members of his ousted regime already have been charged with corruption and abuse of power.
