East Germany's democratic government has changed its mind several times on whether to pursue charges against the aging members of the former hard-line regime that was toppled in last autumn's pro-democracy protests.
 East Germany authorities on Friday interrogated former Communist leader Erich Honecker about his role in the killings of people who tried to flee the country.
The government announced in June that Honecker, Mielke and several border guards would be investigated on possible murder charges in connection with those deaths.
He is staying in a Soviet hospital outside Berlin.
Honecker and Erich Mielke, head of East Germany's once-feared secret police agency, were interrogated by federal prosecutors, said Peter Przybylski, a Justice Ministry spokesman.
