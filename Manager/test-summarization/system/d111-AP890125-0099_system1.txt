Gratz, who denied the allegations, was also accused of helping Proksch in several other ways.
In past newspaper stories, Gratz was accused of providing fabricated evidence from abroad to help Proksch in his claim that the controversial shipment was for a uranium processing plant.
``If it becomes impossible for the president to effectively take a stand on significant issues or to speak up on problems of parliamentarism because everybody is only interested in his context in a single other topic, then he cannot serve the National Council (parliament) in such a way as is his duty.''
Gratz told Parliament today he would give up his seat in February, hence his post as president, one of the most prestigious posts in Austria.
