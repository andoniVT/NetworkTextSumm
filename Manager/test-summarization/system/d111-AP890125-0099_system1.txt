Like Blecha, Gratz is to appear before the parliamentary investigation committee.
Proksch, wanted by Austrian justice on suspicion of murder and insurance fraud, has been variously described to be living in Syria, the Philippines and Latin America.
 Leopold Gratz, the president of Parliament and one of the most powerful politicians in the Socialist Party, resigned today over a scandal surrounding the mysterious sinking of ship 12 years ago.
Gratz, 59, is the second senior Socialist official to step down because of his alleged involvement in the so-called ``Lucona'' scandal, the subject of a widely publicized investigation by a parliamentary committee.
Blecha and Gratz have denied wrongdoing or aiding Udo Proksch, the prime suspect in the sinking of the ship Lucona in the Indian Ocean.
