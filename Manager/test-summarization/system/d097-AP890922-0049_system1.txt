Measuring 7.7 on the Richter scale of ground motion, the earthquake claimed an estimated 110 lives, destroyed 102 buildings and tossed most of the city's 14,000 chimneys into the streets.
``This is a dangerous, killer hurricane, the likes of which few people who have lived all their lives in Charleston have experienced,'' warned Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. Hugo was the first major hurricane to strike Charleston since Hurricane Gracie came ashore 70 miles to the south in 1959.
The storm, packing winds of up to 135 mph, raged into Charleston Thursday night.
 This historic city has survived the ravages of earthquake, battle and storm in its storied 300-year-history, but it faced perhaps its greatest test of all in Hurricane Hugo.
