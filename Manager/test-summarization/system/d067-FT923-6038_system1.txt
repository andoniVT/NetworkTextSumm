Across Florida, some 2m people remained without electric ity yesterday and health officials were warning the public to boil or chemically treat all water.
Only one big hotel in that area has been badly damaged, a Holiday Inn.
Many destroyed power lines are thought to be uninsured, as are trees and shrubs uprooted across a wide area.
US insurers will face a bill in respect of such properties, but Lloyd's exposure there is minimal.
Most of the destruction occurred in a 10-mile band across Homestead, 25 miles to the south of Miami, where a typical house sells for Dollars 100,000 to Dollars 150,000.
