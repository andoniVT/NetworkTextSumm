The market reopened on Monday in an attempt to return to normal.
Dr Manmohan Singh, the Indian finance minister, disappointed traders in the budget at the end of last month.
He postponed corporate tax reforms by a year, denying hopes of a tax cut recommended by an expert group.
Dealers seemed to like this, the BSE index rising by 5.6 per cent on Monday and Tuesday.
They are hoping that foreign portfolio investment will pick up with the restoration of trading after 'Black Friday', and the successful sale of Reliance stock on the BSE by international investors.
Instead, the budget turned out to be a nightmare.
