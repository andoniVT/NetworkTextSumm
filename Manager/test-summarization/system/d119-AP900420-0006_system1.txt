The Sandinista government expelled then-U.S. ambassador Richard Melton and seven other U.S. diplomats on the grounds they were interfering in Nicaragua's internal affairs.
They said the administration believed a female ambassador could relate better than a man to Mrs. Chamorro, who takes office Wednesday.
Mozambique has since moderated its policies and is now off the U.S. government's list of countries under Marxist rule.
Wells' nomination as ambassador to Mozambique in 1986 encountered strong opposition from Senate conservatives who held up the appointment for 11 months in protest against U.S. policy toward that country.
The United States and Nicaragua have not had ambassadors in each other's capitals since July 1988.
