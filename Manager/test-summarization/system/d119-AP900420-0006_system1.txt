Mozambique has since moderated its policies and is now off the U.S. government's list of countries under Marxist rule.
Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., a leader of the campaign to hold up Wells' nomination, said he wanted to pressure the administration into dealing with rightist guerrillas opposed to Mozambique's Marxist government.
The nomination finally was approved in September 1987.
Wells' nomination as ambassador to Mozambique in 1986 encountered strong opposition from Senate conservatives who held up the appointment for 11 months in protest against U.S. policy toward that country.
But the request has been stalled by Senate Democrats, some of whom believe that Eastern Europe has a greater claim on U.S. resources than Nicaragua.
