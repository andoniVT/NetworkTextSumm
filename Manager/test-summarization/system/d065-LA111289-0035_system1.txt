After all, it worked for George Bush.
And he will do so, I believe, by being a vice president who keeps his head down, his nose clean and his life dull.
During the 1988 campaign, I interviewed Quayle and I came away with one overwhelming impression: Dan Quayle would run for President in 1996.
And Quayle knows his future is in sticking to that.
"Almost by job description, a vice president is not permitted to make serious news."
I asked Christie Basham of "Meet the Press" if Quayle had asked in advance who the questioners would be.
But Quayle got no questions like that last week.
