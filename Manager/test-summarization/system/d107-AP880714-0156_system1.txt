Georgia state climatologist Gayther Plummer told the symposium he thought the position of the planet Jupiter had something to do with drought in the Southeast.

He stressed that a hurricane's effect on drought is variable, depending on the intensity and speed of the storm.
Hope said current weather conditions point to more tropical storms, more of which should become hurricanes, in this hurricane season.
