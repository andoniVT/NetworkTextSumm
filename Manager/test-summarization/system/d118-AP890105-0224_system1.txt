After leaving the Senate in 1985, Tower went into business as a defense consultant.
``The senator is expected to make a full recovery.''
Further explanation of the first polyp removal would have to come from Tower's surgeon, who was unavailable for comment Thursday night, the spokesman said.
 Retired Sen. John Tower, the defense secretary-designate, underwent surgery Thursday to remove a colon polyp, a hospital spokesman said.
``Senator Tower is resting comfortably and is listed in fair condition,'' hospital spokesman Steve Habgood said Thursday night.
Tower, 63, a U.S. senator from Texas for 24 years, was admitted to Baylor University Medical Center on Wednesday after undergoing a colonscopy examination last week that revealed the polyp, Habgood said.
