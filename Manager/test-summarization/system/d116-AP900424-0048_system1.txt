In addition to Hubble, Discovery carries a human skull filled with sensors to measure the space radiation that astronauts receive.
Hubble also is expected to shed light on how and when the universe might end.
As a result, they will be able to study stars and galaxies so distant their light has been traveling toward Earth for 14 billion years.
During its 15-year working lifetime, the telescope will provide astronomers with 10 times better resolution and 25 times more sensitivity than ground-based observatories.
NASA estimates it will cost $200 million a year to operate and maintain the telescope in space.
The European Space Agency contributed $250 million for 15 percent of the viewing time.
