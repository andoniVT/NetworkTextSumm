Moslem separatists had warned Indian government officials to leave Jammu-Kashmir state before April or ``face the consequences.''
A telephone caller told a local reporter the abductors were also holding a third hostage and all three men would be killed within 24 hours of a Monday afternoon deadline for releasing three jailed militants.
Roads were blocked around Srinagar, where the hostages were seized, and soldiers tightened security around the Kashmir Valley, where the government launched a crackdown Jan. 20 on the Moslem separatist movement.
Police said the border violence took place in Kupwara district, where at least 20 separatists tried to sneak into neighboring Pakistan to receive military training and buy weapons.
