India says Pakistan trains and arms the militants in Kashmir, at the far northern tip of India.
Moslem separatists had warned Indian government officials to leave Jammu-Kashmir state before April or ``face the consequences.''
The caller said ul-Haq's private secretary also was being held hostage, but that could not be confirmed.

A telephone caller told a local reporter the abductors were also holding a third hostage and all three men would be killed within 24 hours of a Monday afternoon deadline for releasing three jailed militants.
