Peter Foley, who was born in 1859, was a regular until he was well into his 80s.
In 1928, when he was 21, he entered his first Boston Marathon but didn't finish.
Two state troopers will run alongside the 5-foot-6, 130-pound Mr. Kelley into Boston so he won't be trampled by "groupies," as he calls them, clamoring to shake his hand.
I'm struggling at the age of 43. .
And finally there's the Haunted Mile, a stretch where many runners have collapsed.
In all the years since, he has missed the race just once, in 1967.
(He doesn't count the miles he puts in, as many long-distance runners obsessively do, but he says he wouldn't object to an estimate of about 50 miles a week.)
