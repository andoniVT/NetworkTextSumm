He says MGN is inquiring to see whether it can establish if Goldman Sachs was 'aware or should have been aware' that the transfers 'had been effected for improper purposes'.
In his report Sir Robert points to 'certain weaknesses' accepted by the MGN board: Internal controls and operating procedures which failed to identify related party transactions and bring them to the attention of independent directors for approval; Bank mandates authorised by Robert Maxwell and Mr Stoney which permitted the movement of group funds on the authority of Maxwell or directors who were also directors of Maxwell-controlled companies; The audit committee of non-executive directors, which might have reviewed systems and mandates, but was not convened; The finance department's inadequate authority to verify and record the treasury department's activities.
