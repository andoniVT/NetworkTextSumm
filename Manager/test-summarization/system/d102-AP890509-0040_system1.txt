Jack Wall told people at Old St. Patrick Church that God gave the world talents like Miss Ball ``to show us life is not a tragedy, but a comedy with a happy ending.''
The 77-year-old comedian who starred in one of television's biggest all-time hits, ``I Love Lucy,'' died here April 26 of a ruptured aorta, a major blood vessel, eight days after emergency open-heart surgery.
``She taught us that if we could love Lucy, we could love ourselves,'' Wall said.
Florists delivered arrangements including a 3-foot heart of red carnations with the words ``I Love Lucy'' written across.
``Only God knows how many husbands and wives weren't speaking _ and then Monday night rolled around.''
