The game, before a crowd of 75,179 at Joe Robbie Stadium, went undisrupted by racial tensions in Miami.
The first touchdown didn't come until 44 minutes into the 60-minute game, when Cincinnati's Stanford Jennings took a kickoff 93 yards for a score.
Two key players were injured in the first 14 plays, Cincinnati's All-Pro nose tackle Tim Krumrie and San Francisco's tackle Steve Wallace.
The game was a defensive struggle in the first half, which ended in a 3-3 tie.
It was the fifth straight win for a National Football Conference team, but by far the most dramatic _ the previous four had been by an average score of 41-14.
