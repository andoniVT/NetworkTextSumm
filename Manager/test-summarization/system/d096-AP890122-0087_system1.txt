The winning score came at the end of a 92-yard drive, engineered by Montana, whose touchdown pass gave him a Super Bowl record with 357 yards passing.
Two key players were injured in the first 14 plays, Cincinnati's All-Pro nose tackle Tim Krumrie and San Francisco's tackle Steve Wallace.
 In a dramatic finish, the San Francisco 49ers football team won the Super Bowl on Sunday with a 20-16 victory over the Cincinnati Bengals.
Joe Montana's 10-yard touchdown pass to John Taylor with 34 seconds left provided the winning margin.
The victory was achieved through the brilliance of Montana and Jerry Rice, the wide receiver who caught 12 passes for 222 yards, both Super Bowl records.
