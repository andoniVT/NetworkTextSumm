Meanwhile, the Changsha city committee of the Communist Party has held an emergency meeting, urging all departments and the people of the whole city to carry forward the spirit of continuous fighting and unite as one in battling the floods.
The flood has caused serious losses to people along both banks of the river, especially in Changsha, according to the sources.
The city government of Changsha has asked residents within the endangered areas to relocate themselves and remove their property to safer places, in case of the occurrence of more serious flooding.
So far, more than 500,000 soldiers and local residents have moved in to help fight the floods.
