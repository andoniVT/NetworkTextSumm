At least 1,034 people have been killed in the Kashmir valley since New Delhi cracked down on the secessionist movement on Jan. 20.
Pakistan, an Islamic state, denies the charge but says it will back any movement for self-determination by Kashmir's people.
Both sides claim Kashmir, which has been divided into Indian and Pakistani sectors.
It could be just a local incident.
The Pakistani official said: ``This is not a serious situation.
Singh said directors of military operations from both countries were in touch.
``There is no cause for any undue concern since we trust that these localized incidents will be contained and the situation defused,'' United News of India quoted Singh as saying in the Parliament.
