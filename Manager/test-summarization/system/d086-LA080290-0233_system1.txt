In recent days, diplomats said Iraq had massed more than 100,000 troops at the border.
 Iraq's powerful army claimed victory today in its lightning invasion of this small, oil-rich kingdom.
Kuwait's U.S. ambassador said the Iraqis occupied all government buildings in the capital and were moving south toward the country's oil facilities.
Kuwait and U.N. diplomats labeled the coup report a farce.
It was the first time in modern history that an Arab nation had invaded another and taken over its government.
