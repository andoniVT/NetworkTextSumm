He said hundreds of retired soldiers have approached him ``to ask for orders'' to fight the Indian army.
``The border is extremely tense.''
``It is not a normal situation,'' the officer said.
In another sign of increased tensions, Pakistani and Indian officers are no longer accompanying United Nations' military observers as they pass through the borders.
A Paksitan army captain, who said he witnessed the firefight, said unlike the occasional shootings in the past, Indian soldiers appeared to be aiming at Pakistani troops.
The two armies also exchanged gunfire for about 30 minutes before calm was restored.
However, Pakistani forces have now sealed off the border area at Chaukothi, forbidding civilians from entering the area.
