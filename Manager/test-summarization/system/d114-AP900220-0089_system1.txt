However, Pakistani forces have now sealed off the border area at Chaukothi, forbidding civilians from entering the area.
They said there were no reports of casualties from today's firefight at the line, which divides Kashmir between Pakistan and India.
The two armies also exchanged gunfire for about 30 minutes before calm was restored.
``It is not a normal situation,'' the officer said.
He said hundreds of retired soldiers have approached him ``to ask for orders'' to fight the Indian army.
The militants want India's only majority Moslem state to either become independent or join Pakistan.
The soldier was shot in the leg Sunday at a ceasefire line, several miles from the village of Chaukothi, officials said on condition of anonymity.
