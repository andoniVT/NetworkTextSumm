In Brussels, the NATO foreign ministers hailed Sakharov as a pioneer who helped change Soviet society.
The Soviet Congress stood for a minute of silence for their colleague, once considered a national hero for discovering the Soviet hydrogen bomb but later reviled by Kremlin leadership for his uncompromising stands for human freedom.
 World leaders from President Bush to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev today praised Andrei D. Sakharov as a tremendous force for freedom who outlived his Soviet persecutors and saw the liberty he championed take root throughout Eastern Europe.
One Soviet lawmaker called Sakharov a man "such as maybe appears once in a hundred years."
