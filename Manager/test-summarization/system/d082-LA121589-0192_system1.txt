In Brussels, the NATO foreign ministers hailed Sakharov as a pioneer who helped change Soviet society.
In Strasbourg, France, the 518-member European Parliament unanimously paid tribute to Sakharov, whose name it had given to its Human Rights Prize.
"It is just sad he will not be preeminent in the freer future of the Soviet Union," she told reporters in London.
Lech Walesa, a fellow Nobel Peace Prize laureate, said Sakharov's death was "a great loss for reform both in the Soviet Union and everywhere else."
His death represents a great loss, especially at a time with hopes of a positive development in the Soviet Union and in all Eastern Europe."
