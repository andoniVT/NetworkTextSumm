Palace officials have not given details on Hirohito's illness, and they would not comment on Japanese news reports that the emperor has pancreatic cancer.
Hirohito had a temperature of 99.1 degrees Friday evening, up slightly from the morning.
News reports quoted Maeda as saying Hirohito has shed much of his normal 104 pounds during his confinement and now weighs about 66 pounds.
He added that doctors sometimes have trouble determining whether Hirohito is awake.
The emperor responds to queries from aides but is ``less talkative than before,'' Maeda told reporters.
Hirohito has suffered repeated bouts of bleeding but has not discharged blood in nine days.
