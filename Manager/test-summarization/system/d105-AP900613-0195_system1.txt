Grienko said 16 ministry soldiers were killed, four were reported missing and more than 1,000 wounded.
He said in Moscow on Tuesday that ministry troops had to be used in 13 regions of the Soviet Union because of such outbreaks, Tass said.
It was the latest in a series of bloody civil conflicts to trouble President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's government.
Tass said 748 of the injured had to be hospitalized and said a search was continuing for a police officer who vanished June 7.
Besides unrest this month in Kirghizia and Uzbekistan, ethnic violence also has been reported in recent years in Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Tadzhikistan.
