About 20,000 people attended the two-day show, organizers said.
Israeli couples in cutoff jeans and short-sleeved shirts pushed baby strollers from ring to ring to view the more than 50 different breeds ranging from tiny lap dogs like the Yorkshire terriers to Great Danes and St. Bernards.
But although the competition was billed as an international event, organizers conceded there were few if any contestants from abroad.
This was in contrast to 1987, before the uprising began, when a World Dog Show competition attracted scores of foreign competitors to Israel.
``We can find time for other things besides the intefadeh,'' said organizer Avi Marshak, using the Arabic word for uprising to describe the 9-month-old wave of Palestinian violence aimed at ending Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
