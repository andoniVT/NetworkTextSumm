By 1991 the chain's sales had risen to nearly Dollars 44bn, making it the world's largest retailer in terms of revenues, and the Walton family probably America's richest.
Mr Walton also disproved the conventional wisdom that large discount stores could not operate successfully in the small, rural towns of the US south.
Eight years ago, when Wal-Mart's profits were better than expected, he kept a promise to staff by dressing in a grass-skirt to dance the hula on Wall Street.
'Low prices always' became Wal-Mart's motto.
Wal-Mart now operates in 43 US states, selling goods ranging from detergents to golf clubs.
