Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu named Sharon foreign minister on Friday, effectively putting the hard-liner in charge of negotiating Israels final borders with the Palestinians.
 The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, Oct. 10: Just days before heading to the United States for critical negotiations with Palestinian leaders, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu jolted the Middle East peace effort with the appointment of Ariel Sharon as Israeli foreign minister.
 Ariel Sharons appointment as the Israeli foreign minister serves as the bullet of mercy for the Middle East peace process, an official Syrian newspaper said Saturday.
