Freight shipping in the area is also heavy because of its vicinity to the ports of Delfzijl in the Netherlands and Emden in West Germany.
Earlier reports had said that the ship was a passenger ferry, possibly one of the Dutch ships plying the frequent ferry lanes between the coastal islands and the Dutch mainland.
They were taken ashore by a West German helicopter from the island of Borkum, about 30 miles from the site of the sinking, the official said.
The nine crew members boarded two life rafts after the sinking in high winds.
He did not give the ship's origin or destination.
