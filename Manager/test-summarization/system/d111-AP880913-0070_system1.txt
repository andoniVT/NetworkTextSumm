It was not immediately clear what had caused the sinking 29 miles off the Dutch island of Ameland, according to the coast guard spokesman, who was not identified.
 A freighter carrying a cargo of beer sank in the North Sea today off the Dutch coast and all nine crew members were rescued from life rafts, a coast guard spokesman said.
The ship sank at about 12:45 p.m. in high winds, some 28 nautical miles north of the island of Ameland.
There were no casualties, he said.
The coast guard official, who spoke in a Dutch radio interview, identified the ship involved as the Finnish-registered freighter Ra and said it had been carrying a cargo of beer.
