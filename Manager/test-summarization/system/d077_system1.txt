 A violent earthquake rocked Northern California during Tuesday evening's rush hour, caving in a section of the San Francisco Bay Bridge, terrifying World Series fans in Candlestick Park and shaking buildings as far as 200 miles away.
 A major earthquake rocked northern California Tuesday evening, collapsing part of the San Francisco Bay Bridge and shaking Candlestick Park and buildings up to 95 miles away.
Throughout the Bay Area, residents were left to puzzle over why the earthquake savaged some buildings and bypassed others, much like San Francisco was left to wonder why the Marina District was hard hit and others spared.
 The major earthquake that struck the San Francisco Bay area Tuesday occurred in a region seismologists targeted as having the highest probability of a strong quake in Northern California.
In Washington, President Bush said the federal government was prepared to send help to the earthquake area in California and he was sending Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner there to assess the damage.
A quake of 7 magnitude, a ``major'' earthquake, is capable of widespread heavy damage.
The nearest metropolitan area to Tuesday's earthquake, San Jose, has seen nearly a dozen earthquakes of 5 magnitude or greater in the last 10 years, but several of them have been on the Calaveras fault, which generally runs just east of San Jose, more than 10 miles east of San Andreas at this point.
