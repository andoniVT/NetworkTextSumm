Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov introduced a bill in parliament that would increase pension benefits by about 40 percent and upgrade benefits for coal miners, the official Tass news agency reported.
In the Ukraine's Donetsk Coal Basin, the nation's major coal-producing area, miner representatives were discussing another strike.
Tass said that in Donetsk the miners gathered in front of the House of Unions to demand that the government set a deadline for implementing reforms.
 Thousands of miners in the northern Vorkuta region are expanding their strike and some are blocking coal shipments, the Soviet news media reported Friday.
A regional court in Vorkuta ruled that the latest round of strikes is illegal but did not impose any penalties.
