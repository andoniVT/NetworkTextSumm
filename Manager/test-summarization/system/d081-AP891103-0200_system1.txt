Tass said that in Donetsk the miners gathered in front of the House of Unions to demand that the government set a deadline for implementing reforms.
Tens of thousands of miners walked off the job for two hours Wednesday.
In the Ukraine's Donetsk Coal Basin, the nation's major coal-producing area, miner representatives were discussing another strike.
Komsomolskaya Pravda said night-shift workers walked out at three mines in Vorkuta and at another one the miners were still working but were preventing the coal from being shipped outside the region.
The news media gave these accounts of the latest strikes: Workers at the Vorgashor mine in the Arctic Circle, the largest mine in the Vorkuta region, continued their strike for an eighth day, according to Tass.
