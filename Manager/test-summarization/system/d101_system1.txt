; One result of the bungled coup is that Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev -- even though reinstated as head of state -- could be irrelevant to what happens next, analysts said.
; As Gorbachev and Yeltsin met, a crowd of about 1,000 people headed toward the Communist Party headquarters in Moscow, saying they wanted to capture and preserve records that might prove the party supported the coup.
Although Yeltsin supported Gorbachev during the coup, the two men maintain different approaches to Soviet reforms.
; Gorbachevs foreign minister, Alexander Bessmertnykh, who had dropped out of sight during the coup, reappeared today and called the takeover a page in Soviet history that has got to be turned.
; Calls for retribution have sounded since the 3-day-old coup collapsed Wednesday, with Gorbachev beginning a purge of coup plotters and thousands of cheering demonstrators toppling a statue outside the Moscow headquarters of the KGB, whose former leader backed the ouster attempt.
; The coups failure could deal a fatal blow to organized, high-level efforts to thwart reform drives in the Soviet Union by Gorbachev and Yeltsin and significantly alter the balance of power that has characterized Soviet power for the six-year Gorbachev era.
; Gorbachev pledged cooperation with Russian republic President Boris Yeltsin but said he had no plans to leave the Communist Party.
