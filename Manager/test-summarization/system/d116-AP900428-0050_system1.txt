There also were two communications outages totaling several hours.
A colleague, Steve Terry, said Hubble's systems were set at conservative limits for the first operations and that caused many malfunctions.
Two of Hubble's four position-stabilizing gyroscopes stopped working when the door opened, but engineers later got them back on line.
But that proved unnecessary when the door was opened Friday morning, exposing the telescope's finely polished 94.5-inch eye to starlight for the first time.
The crew deployed Hubble on Wednesday but they had stayed close to the telescope in case there was trouble opening the aperture door.
Shriver and pilot Charles Bolden were to run through a series of tests to make certain the shuttle's computers and control jets were ready for return to Earth.
