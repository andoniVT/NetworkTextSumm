 The shuttle that put the Hubble Space Telescope into orbit also carries an instrument used in the 1920s by astronomer Edwin Hubble: the eyepiece from what once was the world's most powerful telescope.
 Discovery's five astronauts returned Sunday for a second attempt to launch the shuttle with NASA's most valuable and celebrated payload, the $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope.
 Countdown clocks resumed ticking Saturday for the shuttle Discovery's delayed launch Tuesday to boost the $1.5-billion Hubble Space Telescope into orbit.
The Discovery roared to a record high orbit of 381 miles, where its crew today will ever-so-carefully deploy the Hubble Space Telescope, billed as the finest optical instrument ever created, a $1.5-billion scope that is half a billion times more powerful than the human eye.
The telescope began orbiting Earth every 97.3 minutes at an altitude of 380 miles -- high above the atmosphere, which has limited the view of ground-based telescopes.
 The Discovery astronauts triumphantly launched the $1.5-billion Hubble Space Telescope one orbit late today after last-ditch commands from Earth freed a stuck solar panel, narrowly averting a daring emergency spacewalk.
Discovery was aiming for an altitude of 380 miles, the highest a shuttle has ever gone, so the telescope can be placed in its proper orbit far above Earth's distorting atmosphere.
