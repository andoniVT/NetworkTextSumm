The Discovery roared to a record high orbit of 381 miles, where its crew today will ever-so-carefully deploy the Hubble Space Telescope, billed as the finest optical instrument ever created, a $1.5-billion scope that is half a billion times more powerful than the human eye.
 Discovery's five astronauts returned Sunday for a second attempt to launch the shuttle with NASA's most valuable and celebrated payload, the $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope.
 Five astronauts boarded Discovery today for a second try at sending the Hubble Space Telescope into orbit to scan the outermost reaches of the universe for clues to the beginning of time.
 The Discovery astronauts triumphantly launched the $1.5-billion Hubble Space Telescope one orbit late today after last-ditch commands from Earth freed a stuck solar panel, narrowly averting a daring emergency spacewalk.
The day after launch, mission specialist Steven A. Hawley will use the shuttle's mechanical arm to lift the 24,250-pound telescope into space.
Less than five hours after it rode into space aboard the shuttle Discovery on Tuesday, the $1.5 billion telescope sent its first test radio signal.
 The shuttle that put the Hubble Space Telescope into orbit also carries an instrument used in the 1920s by astronomer Edwin Hubble: the eyepiece from what once was the world's most powerful telescope.
