The launch marked the beginning of an era -- some say a revolution -- in the exploration of the universe.
"But however it comes out, it's going to be great."
Weiler estimated that only about one-third of the people who were here April 10 made it back for Tuesday's launch.
All five members of the crew are veterans of previous flights.
It is the third flight for Hawley, 38.
That delayed the launch about four minutes.
Sadly, some who have worked so hard for so long were forced to miss the launch.
"After 12 years," astronomer Eric Chaisson of the Space Telescope Science Institute said with a sigh, "it has finally left the Earth."
The Discovery roared to a record high orbit of 381 miles, where its crew today will ever-so-carefully deploy the Hubble Space Telescope, billed as the finest optical instrument ever created, a $1.5-billion scope that is half a billion times more powerful than the human eye.
"It's been long and frustrating," conceded Edward Weiler, program scientist for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, who was visibly shaken by the launch.
"Every bit of 12 years was worth it," Weiler said moments after Discovery lifted off on a sunny day, pierced a fleecy white cloud and emerged on the other side like a spacecraft on a journey to the future.
