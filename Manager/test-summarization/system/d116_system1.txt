Discoverys five astronauts returned Sunday for a second attempt to launch the shuttle with NASAs most valuable and celebrated payload, the $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope.
The Discovery roared to a record high orbit of 381 miles, where its crew today will ever-so-carefully deploy the Hubble Space Telescope, billed as the finest optical instrument ever created, a $1.5-billion scope that is half a billion times more powerful than the human eye.
Five astronauts boarded Discovery today for a second try at sending the Hubble Space Telescope into orbit to scan the outermost reaches of the universe for clues to the beginning of time.
The song was selected in honor of Hubble Space Telescope, which is now open for business, said Mission Control commentator James Hartsfield.
His work gave rise to the Big Bang theory that the universe was created by a tremendous explosion.
This provided observational evidence for the concept, suggested by Einsteins Theory of Relativity, that the universe is expanding, the institute said.
Mission specialist Steven Hawley released Hubble from the end of the shuttles 50-foot-long mechanical arm after a delay in getting one of the telescopes solar wings unfurled.
Countdown clocks resumed ticking Saturday for the shuttle Discoverys delayed launch Tuesday to boost the $1.5-billion Hubble Space Telescope into orbit.
