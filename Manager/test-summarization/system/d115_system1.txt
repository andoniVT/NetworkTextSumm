Seismologists said it was the deadliest earthquake to strike the Himalayan region since 1950.
The Press Trust of India said a school hostel in the town collapsed, killing at least 17 children.
Srivastava said the quake lasted about one minute and aftershocks continued for about an hour.
More than 100 people died when the quake rumbled through the eastern Indian state of Bihar, officials said.
In Nepal, authorities said at least 137 people were dead.
Uttam Dhaubanjar, a 28-year-old bank employee and neighbor of the dead man, said Hyanju had been handing out blankets, milk and other food in Bhaktapur when he was accosted by a group of men who accused him of giving relief supplies only to his own supporters.
Dhaubanjar said he saw about 40 people rounded up by police Thursday night after Hyanju's beating death.
Every increase of one number means the ground motion is 10 times greater.
``The tolls have come in only from urban areas,'' said V.K.
The Red Cross of Nepal issued urgent appeals for blood donations.
In India, the official count rose to 277.
``People started beating him with umbrellas,'' Dhaubanjar said.
``Most of them (were) buried alive under collapsed houses,'' said Indra Shrestha, a social worker involved in the rescue operation in Dharan Bazar, a township of about 100,000 people about 18 miles from the Indian border.
