At least 1,000 people were injured when the quake triggered landslides and house collapses in Bihar and the surrounding states of Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Orissa, all heavily populated, largely agricultural areas.
 A strong earthquake triggered landslides and destroyed houses in the mountainous India-Nepal border region early Sunday, killing at least 237 people and injuring more than 1,500, officials and news reports said.
The earthquake, which struck when most people were still asleep, registered 6.5 on the Richter scale and was the deadliest quake in the region since 1950, when a temblor in the east Indian state of Assam killed 1,500 by official count and 30,000 by seismologists' accounts.
In eastern India, which also was devastated by the quake, cracks were found in the embankments of six rivers in Bihar state, and officials said floods could pose the next threat to the 10 million people.
Aftershocks have persisted since Sunday's earthquake, and rumors of an impending new quake sent thousands of people fleeing into the streets in panic before dawn Tuesday in Katmandu and Dharan.
In Nepal, a Foreign Ministry official, Shailendra Kumar Upadhyaya, said more than 500 people were injured and thousands of houses collapsed from the quake's impact.
