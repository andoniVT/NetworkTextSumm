 A strong earthquake triggered landslides and destroyed houses in the mountainous India-Nepal border region early Sunday, killing at least 237 people and injuring more than 1,500, officials and news reports said.
Officials in Nepal said at least 562 people were killed in Nepal, including 31 people whose bodies were found in remote areas on Wednesday.
Officials said at least 45 people died, but it was not known whether the deaths were due to floods or collapsing houses.
The earthquake, which struck when most people were still asleep, registered 6.5 on the Richter scale and was the deadliest quake in the region since 1950, when a temblor in the east Indian state of Assam killed 1,500 by official count and 30,000 by seismologists' accounts.
