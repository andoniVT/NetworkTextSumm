The 50 organizers Sunday wore black armbands expressing their grief for those killed, injured and left homeless in what they described as that country's worst earthquake of the century.
Red Cross representative Sylvia Stewart said the Red Cross will accept only monetary contributions because shipping supplies there is very expensive.
"Medicine is in such a short supply over there," said Panahi, who along with her husband is a medical doctor.
Representatives of 11 Iranian professional and community groups manned tables near William R. Mason Regional Park, where contributors dropped off supplies, pledged other aid or made financial contributions.
But police accommodated the group, blocking off a bike lane on University Avenue so cars could pull in and unload supplies for the earthquake victims.
