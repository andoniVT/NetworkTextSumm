Both nations are tightly run by royal families and have been close allies.
The only tangible help Saudi Arabia gave the Kuwaiti government in the wake of the invasion was to shelter members of the ruling family, including the emir, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, and the crown prince.
But Friday the radio went off the air after a desperate call: ``The people of Kuwait appeal to you oh brethren, oh Arabs, oh beloved brothers, oh Moslems, rush, rush to their help.''
It was not known if the radio had been discovered by the Iraqis or shut down by the Saudis to avoid provoking Saddam at a time when fears were being expressed that he might invade Saudi Arabia as well.
