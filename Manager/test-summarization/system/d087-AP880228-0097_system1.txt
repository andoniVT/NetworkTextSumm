The best America could do was six medals, its worst Winter Games showing in 52 years.
Van Gennip took more than six seconds off her own world record in the 5,000 meters to win her third gold medal.
In 1936, America won just four medals, but only 51 were available then.
 Time ran out for the U.S. athletes when the Winter Olympics ended Sunday, with a team headed by Brent Rushlaw a tick away from a U.S. bobsled medal and Dutch speed skater Yvonne van Gennip a triple gold medalist with time to spare.
The Olympics wrapped up Sunday evening with a rousing closing ceremony before 60,000 people in McMahon Stadium.
