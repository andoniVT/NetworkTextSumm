President Corazon Aquino on Friday refused to allow Ferdinand Marcos to return home to die and said her government wont permit him to be buried here despite a last appeal from his wife.
President Corazon Aquino said Friday that for security reasons she would not permit deposed President Ferdinand E. Marcos to be buried in the Philippines.
Mrs. Aquino has said she would allow Marcos to return now only if he and his family swore allegiance to her government and returned the money he allegedly stole during his 20-year rule.
Mrs. Marcos said she was trying to contact the president to make a last appeal to Madame Corazon Aquino to open her heart and let Ferdinand come home because he is in very serious condition.
The reports did not say when criminal charges against Marcos, Aquinos ousted predecessor, will be filed or when Mrs. Aquino will allow him to return.
In a statement broadcast by a pro-Marcos radio station, Mrs. Marcos said she has tried to telephone Mrs. Aquino from Hawaii but was told the president was busy.
Mrs. Aquino said the Philippines debt was projected to increase to $29 billion by years end but that much was money that was in fact stolen by the previous government of ousted dictator Ferdinand Marcos.
