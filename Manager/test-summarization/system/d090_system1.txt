Philippine officials were asked repeatedly whether the Aquino government's refusal to allow Marcos to return to the country would remain in effect after his death.
 President Corazon Aquino on Friday refused to allow Ferdinand Marcos to return home to die and said her government won't permit him to be buried here despite ``a last appeal'' from his wife.
 President Corazon Aquino has agreed to allow Ferdinand Marcos to return to the Philippines so that the government can try him on charges of stealing billions of dollars, newspapers said Saturday.
Mrs. Aquino said the Philippines' debt was projected to increase to $29 billion by year's end but that much was money that ``was in fact stolen by the previous government'' of ousted dictator Ferdinand Marcos.
 President Corazon Aquino said today she will not allow Ferdinand Marcos to come home to die and her government will not permit the ousted president to be buried on Philippine soil.
Mrs. Aquino has said she would allow Marcos to return now only if he and his family swore allegiance to her government and returned the money he allegedly stole during his 20-year rule.
 President Corazon Aquino of the Philippines on Monday asked government and industrial leaders to expand economic ties with her nation.
