Mrs. Aquino has refused to allow Marcos into the Philippines, citing security reasons.
``I would like first of all to convey to the family of Mr. Marcos that I do pray that he will still recover from this latest critical illness,'' Mrs. Aquino said.
Mrs. Aquino, whose government has survived six coup attempts, has cited national security in refusing previous requests.
Mrs. Aquino said the Philippines' debt was projected to increase to $29 billion by year's end but that much was money that ``was in fact stolen by the previous government'' of ousted dictator Ferdinand Marcos.
Mrs. Aquino succeeded Marcos after the 1986 uprising that toppled his administration and forced him into exile in Hawaii.
In a statement broadcast by a pro-Marcos radio station, Mrs. Marcos said she has tried to telephone Mrs. Aquino from Hawaii but was told the president was busy.
``I regret to inform Mrs. Marcos, if indeed she is asking me for reconsideration, because as I have said in the past, much as I agree that Mr. Marcos has his rights, I still have to consider also the rights and interests of millions of Filipinos,'' Mrs. Aquino said.
"I regret to inform Mrs. Marcos that as much as I agree that Mr. Marcos has his rights, I still have to consider also the rights and the interests of millions of Filipinos," Aquino told reporters at the presidential palace.
