Philibosian said Reiner hurt prosecutor's chances by dismissing charges against five of the original seven defendants and criticizing the case in a 1986 ``60 Minutes'' interview.
Philibosian instead pointed the finger at the man who defeated him, current District Attorney Ira Reiner.
``To have people who know very little about professional or prosecutorial ethics, to criticize me personally that I have some political motive is totally unjustified.''
``I was a professional prosecutor for 16 years before this case was brought,'' he said.
Robert Philibosian, now in private practice, angrily dismissed accusations that he played up the McMartin case in 1984 _ with the news media acting as eager accomplices _ to boost his public profile as he ran for district attorney.
