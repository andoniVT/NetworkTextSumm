A spokesman for the Indian Defense Ministry said Pakistani troops then fired about 200 rounds from light and medium weapons at Indian border posts in the Uri sector.
At least three demonstrators were killed Sunday night, a Defense Ministry spokesman said in Islamabad.
Pakistan's state-run TV said the Indian guards killed as many as six.
Five were in critical condition in a hospital in Muzzafarabad, the capital of Pakistan-controlled Kashmir, he said, adding he knew of only one death.
Most of them were subsequently released, but the arrests sparked widespread violence.
Indian forces returned fire and the exchange continued for about half an hour, the spokesman said.
