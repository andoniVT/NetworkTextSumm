1986 _ Miss Ball returns to sitcom television in ABC's ``Life With Lucy.''
In his first television series alongside Miss Ball, Gordon was the flustered banker Mr. Mooney in ``The Lucy Show'' from 1962-68.
Gordon first met Miss Ball in 1947 on the radio program ``My Favorite Husband,'' which later became ``I Love Lucy'' on television.
Miss Ball and her late former husband, Desi Arnaz, starred in ``I Love Lucy'' from 1951 to 1957.
But the show, Miss Ball's first series in 12 years, was canceled after less than two months when it drew spectacularly low ratings.
In 1961, Miss Ball married nightclub comic Gary Morton, who became her executive producer, and remained on TV for 12 more years in the weekly ``Here's Lucy'' and ``The Lucy Show.''

Miss Ball's real, onscreen pregnancy marked a milestone in television, and an estimated 44 million viewers _ more than for the inauguration of President Eisenhower _ tuned in on Jan. 19, 1953, to watch Lucy Ricardo have Little Ricky.
In announcing the services, Miss Ball's family said: ``Monday night was the time when most of the nation was used to being with Lucy.''
Bob Rosati, who lives down the street from the Beverly Hills home Miss Ball shared with husband Gary Morton, said he was watching a rerun of ``I Love Lucy'' on Wednesday morning when the screen went black and the words ``In Memory of Lucille Ball, 1911-1989'' appeared.
