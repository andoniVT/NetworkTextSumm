It was the first time that tax authorities have disclosed the amount of an emperor's taxable estate, an official in the Kojimachi Tax Office said.
Akihito has paid $2.99 million in inheritance taxes on his half of his father's estate, which he divided evenly with his mother.
Hirohito's estate included stocks and other personal belongings.
Three sacred treasures _ a mirror, sword and jewels _ which were transferred from emperor to emperor, were tax-exempt, as were about 3,180 items of art owned by Hirohito that were donated to the state, the tax office official said.
Hirohito died of cancer on Jan. 7 at age 87.
