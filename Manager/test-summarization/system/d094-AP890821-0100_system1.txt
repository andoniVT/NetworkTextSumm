Three sacred treasures _ a mirror, sword and jewels _ which were transferred from emperor to emperor, were tax-exempt, as were about 3,180 items of art owned by Hirohito that were donated to the state, the tax office official said.
Hirohito's estate included stocks and other personal belongings.
The Japanese constitution, drafted by U.S. occupation forces shortly after the end of World War II in 1945, stipulates the emperor is the ``symbol of the state and the unity of the people.''
Akihito has paid $2.99 million in inheritance taxes on his half of his father's estate, which he divided evenly with his mother.
