In an accompanying editorial, Victor J. Dzau of Stanford University medical school said the study shows that the renin profile test is potentially useful in identifying high blood pressure patients who are at risk of a heart attack.
The blood and urine test is already being done in many commercial laboratories but for medical conditions other than heart attack risk, said John H. Laragh of the Cardiovascular Center at Cornell University and New York Hospital.
The drug was tested in 38 hospitals in the United States and Canada on patients who had recently suffered a heart attack, said Dr. Arthur Moss, a clinical professor of medicine at the University of Rochester and the principal investigator for the study.
Surprisingly, however, the study found that the drug, diltiazem, increases the chance of a subsequent heart attack in patients whose hearts pump abnormally, experts said.
Studies are under way to see if these ACE inhibitors protect patients against heart attacks as well as lower their blood pressure.
According to the Danish study, Verapamil is about as effective as another variety of blood pressure medicines known as beta blockers at protecting people after heart attacks.
Doctors from the University of Michigan Medical Center studied the effects of sending a few carefully selected heart patients home early.
