In an accompanying editorial, Victor J. Dzau of Stanford University medical school said the study shows that the renin profile test is "potentially useful" in identifying high blood pressure patients who are at risk of a heart attack.
According to the Danish study, Verapamil is about as effective as another variety of blood pressure medicines known as beta blockers at protecting people after heart attacks.
The drug was tested in 38 hospitals in the United States and Canada on patients who had recently suffered a heart attack, said Dr. Arthur Moss, a clinical professor of medicine at the University of Rochester and the principal investigator for the study.
In the study, conducted at 20 community hospitals, doctors compared 897 patients who got Verapamil after heart attacks with 878 people who took placebos.
Studies are under way to see if these ACE inhibitors protect patients against heart attacks as well as lower their blood pressure.
 A drug that eases the heart's workload can cut the risk of new cardiac attacks and death by 20 percent in people recovering from heart attacks, according to a major study released Thursday.
Among patients who had normal blood cholesterol level and were free of diabetes, "those with high renin profiles were seven times more likely to have a myocardial infarction {heart attack} than those with normal or low renin profiles," the researchers wrote.
