The overall risk of dying from heart disease or suffering another non-fatal heart attack was reduced 35 percent among the surgical patients with the healthiest hearts.
 An intestinal operation to lower the cholesterol of heart attack patients reduced their risk for another heart attack or death from heart disease, researchers said today.
But the seven heart attacks in this small group constituted the highest incidence of heart attacks among the patients, 13 heart attacks per 1,000 person-years of observation.
Heart attacks usually occur when clots form in the arteries nourishing the heart and choke off its blood supply.
 A drug that eases the heart's workload can cut the risk of new cardiac attacks and death by 20 percent in people recovering from heart attacks, according to a major study released Thursday.
Researchers at the University of Michigan recently determined that some heart attack victims can be released from the hospital as soon as three days after their heart attacks.
In patients whose hearts had pumping problems, the drug not only didn't help, but it increased the chance of a heart attack by 25 percent.
 A drug used to treat patients complaining of chest pain also could help prevent recurring heart attacks in four out of five heart patients, according to a study published in today's edition of the New England Journal of Medicine.
