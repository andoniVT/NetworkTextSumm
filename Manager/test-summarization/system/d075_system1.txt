It underlies most heart attacks, the single most lethal heart ailment.
However, doctors learned that long inactivity did more harm than good.
Its authors estimated that if angioplasty was widely adopted after heart attacks, it could raise the nation's annual medical bills by $704 million.
The researchers concluded that perhaps 15 percent of heart attacks victims could be safely discharged after three days.

Forty patients were sent home after three days, while the rest stayed seven to 10 days.
A high concentration of salt in the blood also raises pressure.
``This trial has settled one of the most important questions in modern-day cardiology,'' commented Dr. J.
In the experiment, blood and urine samples were obtained at New York City offices and factories from 1,717 workers found to have mild to moderate high blood pressure.
Thus, by measuring for the loss of this substance, researchers could determine the amount of heart damage.
