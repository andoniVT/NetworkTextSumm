 The expensive practice of using balloon catheters to force open heart arteries immediately after heart attacks, now routinely done at many large hospitals, is unnecessary and should be abandoned, according to a major study released Tuesday.
The Cornell cardiologist has argued that in many people with high blood pressure the activity of the renin in the blood is much higher than is warranted by the amount of salt in the blood.
_There were 1,418 heart transplants in 1987, almost nine times as many as in 1983.
At 50 hospitals across the United States, doctors randomly assigned 1,636 patients to get angioplasty within two days of their heart attacks if tests showed there was any chance they might benefit.
Its authors estimated that if angioplasty was widely adopted after heart attacks, it could raise the nation's annual medical bills by $704 million.
Association figures indicated that in 1986 _ the most recent year for which there are statistics _ an estimated 978,500 Americans died from heart attacks, strokes and other diseases of the heart and blood vessels.
With the treatment, the figure dropped to 8 percent.
"It's a new window into heart disease."
Such "high renin" people are at a high risk of a heart attack.
