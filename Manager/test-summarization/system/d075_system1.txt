 The expensive practice of using balloon catheters to force open heart arteries immediately after heart attacks, now routinely done at many large hospitals, is unnecessary and should be abandoned, according to a major study released Tuesday.
Its authors estimated that if angioplasty was widely adopted after heart attacks, it could raise the nation's annual medical bills by $704 million.
Dr. George Beller, a cardiologist and professor at the University of Virginia, said he was also somewhat surprised about the increase in heart attacks in the group suffering pulmonary congestion.
Such "high renin" people are at a high risk of a heart attack.
At 50 hospitals across the United States, doctors randomly assigned 1,636 patients to get angioplasty within two days of their heart attacks if tests showed there was any chance they might benefit.

A comparison group of 1,626 also got TPA.
After 42 days, 11 percent of those in the angioplasty group had died or suffered further heart attacks, as did 10 percent of those in the comparison group.
A year after the treatment, there was no difference in survival.
To be effective, the drugs must be given within about four hours of the start of heart attack symptoms.
