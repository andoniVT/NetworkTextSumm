And for the purpose of debate only, I yield the balance of my time to the outstanding, distinguished senior from Indiana, my good friend, Sen. Dick Lugar.
As I said at the start, Dan Quayle is a man I know and trust.
That is 12 more years of national experience than Michael Dukakis _ and he is running for president.
He's already spent 12 years as a congressman and a senator, tackling the vital national and international issues that affect the lives of all Americans and the future of our country.
And I just don't believe the American people want that kind of experience in the White House.
