We are here to nominate one of the bright young lights in the Republican Party, a man I am proud to say is my colleague, the junior senator from Indiana, Dan Quayle.
Well, three years ago, I received a handwritten plea from a 6-year-old girl who after several days of long, long Senate sessions had a very special problem.
And whenever I needed him, whenever I needed him, Dan was there _ ready and willing to make the tough choices, to cast the tough votes, to transform President Reagan's vision of America into the law of the land.
Corinne and her brothers, Tucker and Benjamin, and their mother, Marilyn, share Dan Quayle with the people of Indiana and the United States Senate.
