The American corporation plans to open five additional restaurants Yugoslavia in the next five years.
The restaurant has 350 seats and employs 110 people capable of serving 2,500 meals per hour.
``I just wanted to taste genuine American hamburgers,'' said Milica Nikolic, a high school student who waited for three hours to taste her first Big Mac.
Glen Cook, an executive of the McDonald's Corp., said during the opening ceremonies, ``We are very excited about the opening of this restaurant, not only because it is the first one in a communist country, but also because it is one of the nicest in Europe.''
