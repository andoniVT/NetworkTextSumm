The next East European McDonald's, and the first in a Soviet bloc country, is to open next month in Budapest, Hungary.
The American corporation plans to open five additional restaurants Yugoslavia in the next five years.
In an effort to keep a high level of services, the management is entitled to fire any employees who fail to perform.
The restaurant has 350 seats and employs 110 people capable of serving 2,500 meals per hour.
They will also share the profits equally even though it will be managed entirely by Yugoslavs.
Glen Cook, an executive of the McDonald's Corp., said during the opening ceremonies, ``We are very excited about the opening of this restaurant, not only because it is the first one in a communist country, but also because it is one of the nicest in Europe.''
