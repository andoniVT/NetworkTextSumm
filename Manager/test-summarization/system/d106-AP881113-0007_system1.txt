Apartheid is South Africa's policy of racial separation.
And a prominent anti-apatheid activist in South Africa said there has been ``no indication (Mandela) would be released today or in the near future.''
A South African government source last week indicated recent rumors of Mandela's impending release were orchestrated by members of the anti-apartheid movement to pressure the government into taking some action.
``It will be a victory for the people of South Africa and indeed a victory for the whole of Africa,'' Saloojee told an audience at the University of Toronto.
Since then, it has been widely rumored Mandela will be released by Christmas in a move to win strong international support for the South African government.
