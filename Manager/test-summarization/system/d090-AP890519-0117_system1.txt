Mrs. Aquino, whose government has survived six coup attempts, has cited national security in refusing previous requests.
``We will follow any decision by the executive branch.''
``We will do everything in our power to see to it that law and order prevail,'' de Villa told reporters.
Marcos supporters, meanwhile, announced they would hold rallies Saturday to pray for his recovery.
Pro-Marcos leaders warned the former president's death in exile would trigger demonstrations.
Mrs. Marcos said she was trying to contact the president ``to make a last appeal to Madame Corazon Aquino to open her heart and let Ferdinand come home because he is in very serious condition.''
