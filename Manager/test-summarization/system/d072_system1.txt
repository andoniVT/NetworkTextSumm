Bernstein was the wunderkind of American music at a time when all respected conductors in the United States were born and trained in Europe.
"Some conductors mellow with age," commented Times music critic Martin Bernheimer when Bernstein conducted the Los Angeles Philharmonic at UCLA in 1986.
At Sony Classical (formerly CBS Records) in New York City, Peter Munves, director of marketing, said this week that in January the company will begin its three-year release of "The Bernstein Collection": "We will release 75 CDs of Bernstein performances, including not only symphonic music by Beethoven and others, but also oratorio performances -- works by Haydn, and the Requiems by Berlioz and Verdi -- and other music never before released on CD."
Bernstein was the first American-born conductor to lead a major symphony orchestra, often joining his New York Philharmonic in playing his own pieces, while conducting from the piano.
The concert will also celebrate Bernstein's accomplishments in popular music with excerpts from such works as ``West Side Story'' and ``On the Town.''
Performances will include the Boston Symphony Orchestra, the Boston Pops Orchestra and the Tanglewood Festival Chorus under the direction of some of the many conductors whose careers have been guided by Bernstein.
 Leonard Bernstein, the Renaissance man of music who excelled as pianist, composer, conductor and teacher and was, as well, the flamboyant ringmaster of his own nonstop circus, died Sunday in his Manhattan apartment.
