The Leonard Bernstein Gala Birthday Performance is a benefit concert scheduled for the composer's 70th birthday, Aug. 25, to raise money for the Tanglewood Music Center, where Bernstein got his conducting start.
Bernstein was the wunderkind of American music at a time when all respected conductors in the United States were born and trained in Europe.
When Koussevitzky retired in 1949, he tried to have the young Bernstein named as his successor, but the BSO's trustees chose Charles Munch because they considered Bernstein too young and tainted by popular music.
Bernstein's announcement was met with dismay in the music world, especially at the New York Philharmonic, which he directed from 1958 to 1969.
The concert will also celebrate Bernstein's accomplishments in popular music with excerpts from such works as ``West Side Story'' and ``On the Town.''
The concert began with selections from Bernstein's ``Mass,'' which he composed for the opening of the Kennedy Center for Performing Arts in Washington, and ended with Psalm 133, in Hebrew, from Bernstein's ``Chichester Psalms.''
 Actresses Lauren Bacall, Betty Comden and Phyllis Newman are among performers in the birthday bash being thrown in August for conductor Leonard Bernstein at the music center where he got his start.
