Bernstein was the first American-born conductor to lead a major symphony orchestra, often joining his New York Philharmonic in playing his own pieces, while conducting from the piano.
The parents preferred the name "Leonard" and called the boy that.
His last conducting appearance was at Tanglewood, Mass., on Aug. 19.
A fan and practitioner of his music, Bernstein met Copland in a typical it-could-only-happen-to-Lenny incident.
"Some conductors mellow with age," commented Times music critic Martin Bernheimer when Bernstein conducted the Los Angeles Philharmonic at UCLA in 1986.
He produced his own shows and versions of "The Mikado" and "Carmen," and performed as piano soloist with his school orchestra and the State Symphony Orchestra.
The maestro also talked with Bernstein privately in his dressing room after concerts, promising to keep in touch.
In recent months, Bernstein canceled performances with increasing frequency.
He etched other niches in history by composing the indelible "West Side Story" and teaching a generation about classical music via the innovative television series "Omnibus."
His father, Samuel Joseph Bernstein, was an entrepreneur of women's hair care products and a Talmudic scholar.
He reveled in music while excelling in athletics and the classical subjects taught at the 300-year-old Boston Latin School.
