; His mysterious death came as Maxwell was embroiled in an international controversy, something common in a life that had the improbable, extravagant and sometimes mysterious character of British fiction.
"We can only assume that Mr. Maxwell slipped and fell overboard," he said.
At 11 a.m., a business call arrived from New York, and the crew discovered that Maxwell was not aboard.
He was last seen alive on the deck of his yacht at 4:45 a.m. EST, Daily News spokesman John Campi said.
An autopsy is planned for today, and the cause of death is officially still unknown.
The body was taken by helicopter to the Gando air base on Grand Canary Island, where it was identified by Maxwell's wife of more than 40 years, Elizabeth, and their son, Phillip.
