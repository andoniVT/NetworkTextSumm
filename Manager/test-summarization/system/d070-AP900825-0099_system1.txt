The Hamburg-based Bild am Sonntag said Saturday that it would report in its Sunday editions that Honecker could be prosecuted in a united Germany, however, for violation of property laws.
Bild said that Erich Mielke, the ex-head of East Germany's former secret police, was also unlikely to go to court in East Germany.
``I am at the end.
I am a dead man,'' Bild quoted Mielke, 82, as saying at his last interrogation.
Honecker is in poor health and remains confined to a Soviet military hospital in Beelitz outside East Berlin.
He is under investigation on allegations of abuse of power, corruption, harboring terrorists and issuing shoot-to-kill orders to prevent East Germans from escaping to West Germany when he served as the country's leader.
