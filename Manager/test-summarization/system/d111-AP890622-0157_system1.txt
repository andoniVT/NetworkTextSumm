Ballard said under laws of the sea, the Bismarck remains the property of the German people.
The Hood was a symbol of British sea power, and its loss stunned the British public and the war government and made sinking the Bismarck a mission of crucial importance.
If unstopped, it could have posed a critical threat to convoys of merchant shipping and undercut British morale at a time when England stood virtually alone against combined German sea and air power.
The sinking occurred only eight days after the Bismarck left Gdynia, Poland, for her first operation.
German vessels later rescued only five more survivors.
