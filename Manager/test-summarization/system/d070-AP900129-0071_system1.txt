Earlier this month, East Germany's Luthern Church had offered to put Honecker up in a home for the aged upon his release from the hospital.
The conviction used to carry the death penalty, but that was abolished in reforms that followed Honecker's ouster Oct. 18.
The charge of high treason carries a maximum life imprisonment.
Honecker's daughter, son-in-law and youngest grandchild also came to see him off at the hospital, ADN quoted Vogler as saying.
She kissed him goodbye before he was taken away in a large limousine.
West German television showed an impassive Honecker being led out of the hospital by his wife, Margot, in pre-dawn darkness.
