MR MICHAEL STONEY, a senior executive in a number of Maxwell companies, is named as one of three people primarily responsible for more than Pounds 180m of unusual payments from Mirror Group Newspapers bank accounts during the last financial year, according to the chairmans statement released with MGN accounts yesterday.
On May 29 last year, Mr Kevin Maxwell sent a fax to Mr Larry Wood, an executive director of Goldman Sachs, telling him that two parcels of 12.5m MCC shares each would be bought by the Swiss trusts with Pounds 55.33m provided by BIT, a Maxwell private company.
The writs also allege that on May 28 1991 - the same date Mr Kevin Maxwell arranged for the pension fund share transaction to be paid for - Goldman was due to receive Dollars 58.2m for an unrelated transaction selling MCC stock to an unnamed American lawyer with close connections to Robert Maxwell.
; In another development, The Financial Times said today that documents show creditors face losses of at least $905 million on loans to Robert Maxwells private companies.
The fax, signed by Mr Maxwell, said that the funds would be remitted to Goldman Sachs by Bishopsgate Investment Trust PLC from its account at National Westminter Bank plc, 41 Lothbury.
