 MR MICHAEL STONEY, a senior executive in a number of Maxwell companies, is named as one of three people primarily responsible for more than Pounds 180m of 'unusual' payments from Mirror Group Newspapers bank accounts during the last financial year, according to the chairman's statement released with MGN accounts yesterday.
On May 29 last year, Mr Kevin Maxwell sent a fax to Mr Larry Wood, an executive director of Goldman Sachs, telling him that two parcels of 12.5m MCC shares each would be bought by the Swiss trusts with Pounds 55.33m provided by BIT, a Maxwell private company.
In his report Sir Robert points to 'certain weaknesses' accepted by the MGN board: Internal controls and operating procedures which failed to identify related party transactions and bring them to the attention of independent directors for approval; Bank mandates authorised by Robert Maxwell and Mr Stoney which permitted the movement of group funds on the authority of Maxwell or directors who were also directors of Maxwell-controlled companies; The audit committee of non-executive directors, which might have reviewed systems and mandates, but was not convened; The finance department's inadequate authority to verify and record the treasury department's activities.
 Two writs have been filed alleging that Goldman Sachs, the US-based investment bank, assisted in diverting Pounds 55m from two pension schemes controlled by Robert Maxwell to ensure its own debts from Maxwell interests would be repaid.
