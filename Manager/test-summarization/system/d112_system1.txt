 DOCUMENTS which show for the first time that both Mr Robert Maxwell and his son Kevin were intimately involved in substantial purchases of shares in Maxwell Communication Corporation, one of their own public companies, have been obtained by the Financial Times.
At 6.29pm on May 29, Mr Maxwell sent the two other faxes to Mr Wood on behalf of the two pension funds.
Each pension fund sold 12.5m shares at a price of 219.78p a share, or Pounds 27.47m in total.
The MCC purchases by Yakosa and Servex are the object of an investigation by the SFO into an alleged illegal scheme to support the MCC share price.
Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, acted as broker to the deals.
Meanwhile, a director of a secretive Swiss trust, Mr Werner Rechsteiner, has broken his silence and has admitted that transfers of MCC shares to his trust, which are at the centre of an investigation by the Serious Fraud Office, were made on the instructions of Robert Maxwell.
The documents demonstrate that Bishopsgate Investment Trust, a private UK company controlled by the Maxwell family, provided Pounds 55.33m on behalf of the two Swiss trusts so that they could pay for the MCC shares.
