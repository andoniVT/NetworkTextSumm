Their daughter, Sally Smith, and son, Bill Butler, were flying to Costa Rica on Sunday evening to be reunited with their parents, Vallecillo said.
They were sailing from Coral Gables, Fla., near Miami, to Honolulu, where they planned to vacation, Vallecillo said.
Butler told U.S. Coast Guard officials that several times the couple spotted merchant ships but were unable to flag them down.
As the lifeboat drifted slowly eastward over two months, the Butlers said, they caught between 400 and 500 pounds of fish and survived multiple shark attacks by sealing punctures with a raft repair kit.
``This is the first (case) I've documented.''
