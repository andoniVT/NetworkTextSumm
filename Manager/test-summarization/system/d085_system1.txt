Officials said property damage from Hugo escalated because the storm scored a direct hit on Charleston and then, instead of heading out to sea, veered northwest, hitting other population centers, including Charlotte, N.C. Losses Still Being Tallied Nationwide, based in Columbus, Ohio, is the biggest home and auto insurance in North Carolina, where damage was unexpectedly high, and is the third-largest insurer in South Carolina.
Additionally, Nationwide Insurance Co. said it expects claims close to $100 million, more than triple the $31 million that the company paid for damages caused by Hurricane Elena when it swept through Florida, Alabama and Mississippi in 1985.
Hurricane-force winds first hit the coast by 9:15 p.m. EDT, and about three hours later the eye of the storm passed over the Isle of Palms just east of Charleston, said Bob Sheets, director of the National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla.
The coastal area could expect hurricane force winds for 10 to 12 hours once the eye comes ashore, officials said.
Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center used computer models to track Hugos path into Charleston, S.C. All the worlds knowledge about meteorological conditions and forecasting changes in those conditions is embodied in those models, said Thomas Pyke, head of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrations satellite service.
