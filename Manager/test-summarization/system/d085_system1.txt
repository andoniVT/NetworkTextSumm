Officials said property damage from Hugo escalated because the storm scored a direct hit on Charleston and then, instead of heading out to sea, veered northwest, hitting other population centers, including Charlotte, N.C. Losses Still Being Tallied Nationwide, based in Columbus, Ohio, is the biggest home and auto insurance in North Carolina, where damage was unexpectedly high, and is the third-largest insurer in South Carolina.
 Supercomputers, satellites and the expertise of several hurricane forecasters predicted the destructive path Hurricane Hugo would follow, giving people plenty of time to flee the South Carolina coast.
``This is a dangerous, killer hurricane, the likes of which few people who have lived all their lives in Charleston have experienced,'' warned Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. Hugo was the first major hurricane to strike Charleston since Hurricane Gracie came ashore 70 miles to the south in 1959.
Hurricane-force winds first hit the coast by 9:15 p.m. EDT, and about three hours later the eye of the storm passed over the Isle of Palms just east of Charleston, said Bob Sheets, director of the National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla.
The real forecasting problem with Hugo was predicting the intensity of the storm, which was upgraded to a Category 4 hurricane just hours before it slammed into Charleston.
