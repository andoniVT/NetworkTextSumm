``We are surprised that the court would base its decision on events which occurred half a century ago, overlooking the meticulous fashion in which the Academy has protected the integrity of its institutional symbol for decades,'' Malden said in a statement.
The small Academy Award statue is part of the public domain, U.S. District Court Judge Laughlin Waters said in a ruling released Thursday.
The academy claimed that the Star Award, the trophy look-alike made by Creative House Promotions, violated copyright laws, diluted the academy's trademark and represented unfair competition.
The Star Award depicted a naked, muscular male much like the Oscar, just two inches shorter and holding a star instead of a sword.
