As well as appearing in Russian, Moscow News also prints editions in English, French and other languages.
But most of the newspaper's circulation is among foreign tourists and readers abroad, so relatively few Soviets would see the Sakharov article.
Sakharov has been quoted numerous times by Soviet media since his return from exile, but the article in Moscow News was the longest devoted to him so far.
It reported that when the unidentified author refused, Sakharov said, ``It's too bad that duels are abolished in our times,'' and slapped him.
``Sakharov put a copy of his book in front of him and proposed that he write an apology for all the lies that were published,'' the paper said.
