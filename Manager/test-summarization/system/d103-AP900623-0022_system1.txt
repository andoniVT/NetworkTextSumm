Gobadi said the country cannot properly assist earthquake victims because its treasury has been spent in a war with neighboring Iraq and against internal opposition.
As Gobadi spoke Friday, members of the organization denounced Iran's government at a noisy rally held in a park across the street from the White House.
Gobadi said his 25-year-old group had helped depose the shah but had no part in organizing the Islamic republic.
Gobadi said shoddy housing in which the government forced people to live was the cause for the widespread loss of life.
