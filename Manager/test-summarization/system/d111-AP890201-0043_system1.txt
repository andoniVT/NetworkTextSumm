Because the station is equipped for only 40 people, food has been rationed to two meals a day, a National Science Foundation statement said.
The passengers and most of the crew were taken by cruise ship to the South Shetland Islands, from which they were airlifted to the South American mainland Sunday.
Before the sinking, Argentine officials had discounted a spill.
It said two Argentine salvage vessels were expected to arrive Thursday or Friday.
``Scientists are concerned that some research search projects may already have been affected by the leak,'' a foundation statement said.
Agency spokesman Jack Renerie said Tuesday before the ship sank that the leak, which was threatening penguins and other wildlife, had stopped.
