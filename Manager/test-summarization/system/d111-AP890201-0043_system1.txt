The ship ran aground Saturday about two miles from Palmer Station, a U.S. research facility on the Antarctic Peninsula, the continent's tip.
``Scientists are concerned that some research search projects may already have been affected by the leak,'' a foundation statement said.
Tourists aboard and the crew had been evacuated from the vessel, which was 600 miles south of Cape Horn, the tip of South America.
 An Argentine supply ship that ran aground off Antarctica sank Tuesday in heavy seas and high winds, the government said, and there was concern oil in its hold could leak and damage the environment.
There were no immediate details about the extent of damage to the wildlife in the pristine surroundings.
