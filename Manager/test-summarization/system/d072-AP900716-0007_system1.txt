Bernstein issued a separate statement apologizing to his fans and sponsors and saying that he had asked LSO principal conductor Michael Tilson Thomas and Japanese conductor Eiji Oue to fulfill his conducting responsibilities.
Kraut did not provide the time or date of Bernstein's departure.
The Japan festival is believed to be the first festival in Asia where young musicians can train with a professional orchestra.
Complete rest for an extended period is required if this remarkable man is to regain his usual high energy level,'' said Dr. Kevin Cahill, the conductor's personal physician.
Bernstein, 71, has suffered from severe influenza, pleurisy, and pneumonia since the beginning of the year, Cahill said in a statement released by Harry Kraut, Bernstein's manager.
