Kraut's statement said it was not known whether Bernstein would be able to conduct next month at the Tanglewood festival or during the Tanglewood Music Center Orchestra Tour in Europe later this summer.
The Japan festival is believed to be the first festival in Asia where young musicians can train with a professional orchestra.
Bernstein inaugurated the festival last month.
On Saturday and Sunday, Bernstein canceled appearances with an orchestra of young musicians from the Pacific-Asia region who had been training under principals of the LSO during the three-week Pacific Music Festival in northern Japan.
Bernstein issued a separate statement apologizing to his fans and sponsors and saying that he had asked LSO principal conductor Michael Tilson Thomas and Japanese conductor Eiji Oue to fulfill his conducting responsibilities.
