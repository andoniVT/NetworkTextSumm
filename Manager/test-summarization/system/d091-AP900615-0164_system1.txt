Flood waters in most areas had subsided by Thursday night, according to authorities.
Wayne Tresemer, the county's Disaster Services director, said water was standing up to 5 feet deep in some streets in the town of Newark, and the fire department and other agencies used boats to evacuate some residents.
Landslides were reported in the Pittsburgh area, and many city streets were closed during the storm.
Most of the problems in West Virginia were confined to road closures and basement flooding.
``It's a pretty good mess, especially in the northern end of the county,'' said Clarence Weston, a dispatcher with the Marshall County Sheriff's Department in Moundsville, W.Va. ``We had 3.5 inches of rain in a two-hour period last night.''
