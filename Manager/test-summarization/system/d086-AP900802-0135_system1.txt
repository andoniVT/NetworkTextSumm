U.S. officials monitoring the situation had no reports of harm to U.S. citizens in Iraq, White House spokesman Roman Popadiuk said.
Iraqi first threatened military action against its former ally Kuwait two weeks ago.
Diplomats said the invasion was too swift to arrange the evacuation of nationals, and foreigners were asked to keep a low profile.
Kuwait's U.S. ambassador said the Iraqis occupied all government buildings in the capital and were moving south toward the country's oil facilities.
A Pentagon source said U.S. Navy ships were diverted to the region, but President Bush said the subject of intervention was not being discussed.
