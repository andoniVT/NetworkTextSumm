``Now that reunification is about to be a fact, they won't be blaming the Jews'' for a divided Germany, Bronfman explained.
In fact, he said, reunification might cause a decline in anti-Jewish feelings.
Bronfman said he does not fear a resurgence of anti-Semitism once the two Germanys are united.
For example, Germany's borders ``must be sealed in cement,'' and the country should not be allowed nuclear weapons, he said.
In the long run, he said, a united Germany can be ``a very positive thing'' for Europe, but certain precautions must be taken to prevent a repeat of history.
And part of that moral statement is to see that it (the Holocaust) doesn't happen again,'' Bronfman said.
