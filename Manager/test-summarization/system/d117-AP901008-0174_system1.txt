``The prize has become internationally known, and the worldwide demand for the winning book, in English and translations, is spectacular,'' said Shaw.
The prize was first awarded in 1969 after talks between Booker and the Publishers' Association on the need for a significant literary award to encourage and reward good writing.
As public debate rages over who's in, who's out and who might win, with bookmakers across the country calling the odds, the jurors meet again and finally select the winner on the afternoon of announcement day.
There were 110 submissions last year.
Each juror reads every book submitted, lists about six favorites and meets the other jurors to select and announce six finalists.
