Other activities by Sakharov have gone unreported here, including his delivery to Gorbachev of a list of 200 Soviets reportedly held in prison, labor camp or psychiatric hopsitals because of their political views.
A celebrity in the West since he helped form the Soviet dissident movement of the 1970s, Sakharov spent nearly seven years in internal exile after criticizing the Kremlin's military drive into Afghanistan.
 The visit by human rights activist Andrei D. Sakharov to the United States has gone virtually unreported by state media, with a radio broadcast saying only he had voiced opposition to the U.S. ``Star Wars'' program.
