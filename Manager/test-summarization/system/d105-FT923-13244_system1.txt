The greatest threat is expected to come from hundreds of armed fighters on both sides, operating independently in a dozen or so bands outside the control of either Russian or Georgian authorities.
The peace-keepers' mission is to form a physical barrier between the two sides, opening the way to future talks.
The peace-keepers have been issued with UN-style light-blue helmet bands and matching chevrons on their sleeves.
Hundreds have been killed since 1990 in fighting between Georgians and Ossetians.
Russia and Georgia were cautiously optimistic that Ossetia could be the first region of the former Soviet Union where armed conflict could be resolved with the help of 'political measures and actions'.
