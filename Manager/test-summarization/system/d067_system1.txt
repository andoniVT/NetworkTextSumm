Mr Robertson said: 'No one knows at this time what the exact loss is'.
The storm, which brought havoc to southern Florida on Monday and then headed north-west across the Gulf of Mexico, had made landfall late on Tuesday night some 60 miles south-west of the city in the agricultural Cajun country.
However, if this happens, it would suffer a post-tax loss of Dollars 40m (Pounds 20m).
It has a branch in Orlando.
More than Dollars 15bn of damage may have been caused in all, but was mostly to uninsured property, he said.
Many destroyed power lines are thought to be uninsured, as are trees and shrubs uprooted across a wide area.
What this means is that GA is able to pass on its losses to external reinsurers once a certain claims threshold has been breached.
The real question, he added, is the level of reinsurance available to the UK underwriters.
Mr George Lloyd-Roberts, chairman of Lloyd's Underwriters' Non-Marine Association, said that, unless damage claims exceeded Pounds 3bn, the Lloyd's insurance market would feel little impact.
The Lloyd's member, in close contact with leading insurers in Florida, said that damage to insured property was remarkably small.
