 A passenger ferry sank off the Caribbean coast while being towed to port, and 59 people drowned and six are missing, authorities and news reports said today.
The move followed the July 21 capsizing of a ferry on the Min River in Southwestern Sichuan province in which 133 people died, and the July 25 sinking of a passenger boat on the Yangtze River in which 71 people drowned.
He said by telephone that the ferry ran out of fuel midway on a 16-mile run across the bay from Livingston to Puerto Barrios and sank after a naval patrol boat tried to tow it to port.
Authorities said the water was still rising and the submerged boat was sinking in the river bed.
Giron Arreola also said that passengers ran to one side of the ferry while it was under tow just before the ferry sank.
Gaytan said navy patrol boats, fishing vessels and private craft have been searching the bay for survivors and recovering bodies.
 Investigators were looking into complaints from some survivors that the crew abandoned the ferry without helping passengers and that some crew members pushed aside passengers to get to lifeboats.
