 A passenger ferry sank off the Caribbean coast while being towed to port, and 59 people drowned and six are missing, authorities and news reports said today.
He said by telephone that the ferry ran out of fuel midway on a 16-mile run across the bay from Livingston to Puerto Barrios and sank after a naval patrol boat tried to tow it to port.
; Survivors said that after the ship struck the reef, crew members herded them to one side of the listing boat to keep it from heeling over, then pushed passengers aside to get to the lifeboats.
The move followed the July 21 capsizing of a ferry on the Min River in Southwestern Sichuan province in which 133 people died, and the July 25 sinking of a passenger boat on the Yangtze River in which 71 people drowned.
Officials had yet to determine the exact cause of the sinking, but Giron Arreola said the ferry captain was slow to respond to requests by the skipper of the naval patrol boat to take control of the ferry's wheel once it was under tow.
