The 12{-ton, 43-foot-long telescope, about the size of a bus, is named for astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, who died in 1953.
Significant data will follow in a month or two.
During its 15-year working lifetime, Hubble is expected to help determine the age and size of the universe.
It is capable of detecting objects 50 times fainter and with 10 times greater clarity than the best ground-based observatory.
In an orbit high enough to avoid Earth's distorting atmosphere, Hubble will allow astronomers to study stars and galaxies so distant their light has taken 14 billion years to reach Earth.
``If you get us home by Sunday, I'll go to practice.''
