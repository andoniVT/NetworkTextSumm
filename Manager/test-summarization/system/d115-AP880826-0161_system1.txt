Uttam Dhaubanjar, a 28-year-old bank employee and neighbor of the dead man, said Hyanju had been handing out blankets, milk and other food in Bhaktapur when he was accosted by a group of men who accused him of giving relief supplies only to his own supporters.
Sunday's earthquake registered 6.5 on the Richter scale, which records energy released by a tremor according to ground motion measured by a seismograph.
A reading of 6 indicates the possibility of severe damage, while 7 signifies a major quake.
Rana, who is minister of local development and legislative, affairs, called Hyanju's death ``political murder.''
As Hyanju's body was taken through the winding streets of Bhaktapur, a 12th-century town of ancient Hindu temples, thousands of the town's 50,000 people jammed streets, temple steps and the balconies of brick and mud houses.
