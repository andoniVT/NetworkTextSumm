Federal emergency officials have estimated that the next ``big one'' _ a quake like the 1906 San Francisco quake _ could kill 3,000 to 14,000 people in southern California, and 3,000 to 11,000 people in the Bay Area.
Faced with conflicting estimates, the Geological Survey issued a July 1988 report that it said represented a consensus on the debate.
But studies in recent years have reminded the Bay Area that it also faced another seismic disaster, and those studies became a reality Tuesday when a quake measuring 6.9 on the Richter scale rocked the Bay area.
The last great southern California quake, in 1857, killed very few people in a region that was then sparsely populated.
