The question is when,'' Peck said.
``The question is not whether a big earthquake is coming.
Federal emergency officials have estimated that the next ``big one'' _ a quake like the 1906 San Francisco quake _ could kill 3,000 to 14,000 people in southern California, and 3,000 to 11,000 people in the Bay Area.
Thus most assumed that Los Angeles, not the Bay Area, would fall victim to the next seismic catastrophe; the 1988 USGS report cast doubt on this assumption.
The last great southern California quake, in 1857, killed very few people in a region that was then sparsely populated.
``There was some debate about the length of the rupture and the size of the earthquake.''
