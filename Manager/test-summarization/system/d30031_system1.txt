Saturday, one of the astronauts, Lt. Col. Nancy Currie of the Army, is to have the shuttles robot arm hoist Unity from the payload bay and secure it to Endeavours docking system, moving the unit from a horizontal to a vertical position.
Starting Monday, a pair of space-walking astronauts are to hook up electrical connections and data cables between the units, attach antennas and install tools and handrails for future visitors.
Currie took almost two hours to painstakingly move Zarya above the American-made Unity docking port positioned in Endeavours cargo bay.
The shuttles 50-foot robot arm had never before handled an object as massive as the 41-foot, 44,000-p
