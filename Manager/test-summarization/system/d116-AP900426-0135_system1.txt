The 8{-hour procedure was performed 380 miles above Earth, 70 miles higher than any shuttle has ever flown.
Wojtalik said the cause of the problem is unknown.
One of the telescope's solar arrays unreeled from its mast as expected and started providing power to the telescope's batteries, which otherwise had only eight hours of charge.
Too much light could damage the telescope's sensitive instruments.
After Wednesday's deployment, Shriver gently backed Discovery away from the telescope and put the shuttle through a series of maneuvers, the last one completed this morning, to ``park'' Discovery in orbit 46 miles behind Hubble.
We saw a great deploy yesterday and Hubble had a good night while you were asleep.''
