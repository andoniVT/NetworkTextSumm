Tall cranes lifted the heavy rubble, while workers with flashlights picked through the smaller pieces.
All but one of the victims, who ranged in age from 7 to 67, were killed along Airport Boulevard, a busy thoroughfare that seemed to be a guide for the tornado on its deadly march.
The tornado seemed to catch everyone by surprise.
By far the worst damage was in Huntsville, where an estimated 1,000 people were left homeless and National Guardsmen stood watch against looting Thursday.
A tornado warning was broadcast at 4:39 p.m., two minutes after the twister was sighted on the ground at the old Huntsville airport.
