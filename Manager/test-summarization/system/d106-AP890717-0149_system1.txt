Mrs. Mandela-Amuah said of her father's possible release, ``I always firmly believe that you can't predict what the South African government will do.''
She said, ``He (Nelson Mandela) believes that education is the key to all doors and he would like to see all of his children get an education; in fact all of the black children ... because you cannot claim to want to rule the country and be the leaders of the future if you have people who are untrained and don't have any skills.''
One of their daughters, Makaziwe Mandela-Amuah, arrived with her three children from the United States, where she is studying for a doctoral degree in anthropology at Amherst College in Massachusetts.
