That meeting sparked speculation that Mandela would be freed this year.
Mrs. Mandela-Amuah said of her father's possible release, ``I always firmly believe that you can't predict what the South African government will do.''
She said the family normally spent Mandela's birthday at home, fasting and praying, but members would visit him this year on his birthday ``because he has invited us to come and share it with him.''
 The largest family group to visit black leader Nelson Mandela since he was jailed 27 years ago gathered in Cape Town for a meeting Tuesday with the prisoner on his 71st birthday.
