The diplomatic world has remained largely unconviced by the flood of statements issued from Iraq in the name of the Provisional Free Kuwait Government.

The first statement said the provisional government ``finds that one of its primordial obligations is to remedy the harm done by the deposed, corrupt government to our brothers in Iraq.''
