; The U.S. military began flying home hundreds of the 28,000 Americans who crowded onto Subic Bay Naval Base as a bizarre tropical blizzard of thick volcanic ash caused power failures across the base Friday during a third day of increasingly violent eruptions of Mount Pinatubo.
; If it does erupt, the deadly hot ash produced by the volcano could sweep across adjoining Clark Air Base, he said.
; The five USGS scientists are among the few remaining people at Clark Air Base, which was evacuated along with thousands of Filipinos living near the volcano.
; Even if the volcano does not erupt, the threat of eruption is likely to keep the base closed for weeks at least, Lipman said.
; At a refugee center in Olongapo, 35 miles southwest of the volcano, survivors told of the sky growing dark, then of hearing a tremendous explosion followed by a rain of ash.
; Friday's eruptions hurled ash over Clark, 10 miles east of the volcano, and Subic, 25 miles southwest, where the Clark personnel had been temporarily housed.
; Clark Air Base is in Angeles, a city of more than 300,000 people about 50 miles north of Manila.
 The volcano, about 10 miles west of the air base, came to life last week after six centuries of dormancy.
