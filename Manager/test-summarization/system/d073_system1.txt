; If it does erupt, the deadly hot ash produced by the volcano could sweep across adjoining Clark Air Base, he said.
; Clark Air Base is in Angeles, a city of more than 300,000 people about 50 miles north of Manila.
; The U.S. military began flying home hundreds of the 28,000 Americans who crowded onto Subic Bay Naval Base as a bizarre tropical blizzard of thick volcanic ash caused power failures across the base Friday during a third day of increasingly violent eruptions of Mount Pinatubo.
; The five USGS scientists are among the few remaining people at Clark Air Base, which was evacuated along with thousands of Filipinos living near the volcano.
; Friday's eruptions hurled ash over Clark, 10 miles east of the volcano, and Subic, 25 miles southwest, where the Clark personnel had been temporarily housed.
 The volcano, about 10 miles west of the air base, came to life last week after six centuries of dormancy.
; "In the worst case, a really big eruption, all of Clark Air Force Base could be covered" with glowing ash, Lipman said.
; Angeles, a city of 300,000, is adjacent to Clark Air Base, but authorities had not ordered a general evacuation there.
; But officials issued no general evacuation order for Angeles, even though the city is next to Clark Air Base.
