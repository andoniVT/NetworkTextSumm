; Two more thundering explosions rocked Mount Pinatubo late today.

; The Clark command center operated with a skeletal crew, but the base's operations were suspended.
; President Corazon Aquino visited refugee centers near Angeles briefly before returning to Manila for independence day celebrations.
Most of the base's residents had been evacuated Monday.
