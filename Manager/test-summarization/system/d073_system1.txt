Punongbayan said Tuesday that the site was in the path of the volcanic flow from Mount Pinatubo during its last major eruption, in 1380.; About 19,000 Filipinos earlier had been evacuated from three provinces near the volcanos slopes and were housed in 25 makeshift evacuation centers outside the projected danger zone.
; The U.S. military began flying home hundreds of the 28,000 Americans who crowded onto Subic Bay Naval Base as a bizarre tropical blizzard of thick volcanic ash caused power failures across the base Friday during a third day of increasingly violent eruptions of Mount Pinatubo.
; If it does erupt, the deadly hot ash produced by the volcano could sweep across adjoining Clark Air Base, he said.
; Punongbayan said Mount Pinatubo could remain active for years if it follows the pattern of similar Philippine volcanoes.
; Other recent volcanoes that erupted on the same scale were El Chichon in Mexico in 1983 and Nevado del Ruiz in Colombia in 1985.; If it does have a massive eruption, Pinatubos primary means of causing death and destruction would be hellish avalanches of hot ash -- 1,000 degrees or more, flowing and billowing at up to 100 mph, engulfing and searing all in their path.
; Even if the volcano does not erupt, the threat of eruption is likely to keep the base closed for weeks at least, Lipman said.
