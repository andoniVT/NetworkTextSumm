But a medical exam by a team of doctors found him in condition to be questioned and to stand trial, ADN said.
 East Germany's deposed Communist leader Erich Honecker is too sick to be held in jail but is fit enough to be tried, the official news agency ADN reported Monday.
Honecker and the seven are charged with corruption and abuse of office.
They had been arrested soon after Honecker's fall but were later released because of advanced age and poor health.
Honecker has been staying at a Soviet military hospital outside East Berlin.
ADN, quoting a Health Ministry statement, said Honecker was still recovering from surgery for kidney cancer in January and was not well enough to be incarcerated.
