ADN quoted Federal Prosecutor Guenter Seidel as saying he intended to continue his investigation against the former East German leaders, although their poor health often disrupted the proceedings.
They had been arrested soon after Honecker's fall but were later released because of advanced age and poor health.
The medical panel concluded that seven other former Communist officials, who had been among Honecker's closest aides, were all fit to prosecute and to be placed in custody, ADN said.
Honecker, 77, ruled East Germany for 19 years until he was ousted in October as a wave of pro-democracy demonstrations swept the country, leading to the peaceful overthrow of the Communist government and the opening of the Berlin Wall.
