Lugar said Kohl told the Americans that reunification would be a ``procedure that depends on many events in Germany and Europe'' and that the Soviet Union and the United States have a role to play.
He said the purpose of the trip was to ``visit with the Germans on their judgments about all of these procedures that are going on.''
Lugar came to Bonn with eight other members of the U.S. Senate's arms control observer group.
The dramatic events in East Germany and whirlwind reforms elsewhere in the East bloc are likely to be a main topic of their talks.
But the Soviets, who suffered millions of deaths fighting a unified Germany in World War II, have said the idea of German reunification is ``dangerous and unrealistic.''
