The chancellor said that almost all of the political parties and opposition groups in East Germany now support reunification.
"Political and economic union go hand in hand," Kohl said.
Asked how soon the two Germanys could merge, Kohl declared that the March election has to come first, and "then I think it will all go very quickly."
But if the two Germanys are fused before the West Germany election in December, the growing number of Social Democratic voters in what today is East Germany -- who would presumably be allowed to vote in December -- could easily tip the balance away from the Christian Democrats, pushing Kohl out of the government leadership.
