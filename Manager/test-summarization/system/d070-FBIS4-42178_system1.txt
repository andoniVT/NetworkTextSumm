Since then, he and his wife had been living in a house in a wealthy Santiago area.
After being released from prison in 1993, Honecker had traveled to Santiago to join his daughter, who is married to a Chilean.
He also said he cannot say whether Margot Honecker, who had informed Becker of her husband's death, will be allowed to stay in Chile.
This will be decided by the family.
Becker said he did not know whether Honecker has left a will or where the funeral would be held.
His colleague, Wolfgang Ziegler, had said earlier that the former most powerful man in the GDR had obviously died from his liver cancer.
