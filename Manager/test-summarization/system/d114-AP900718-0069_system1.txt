The announcement of federal rule reflected the belief that Jammu-Kashmir state was too unstable to be run by an elected local government.
Indian officials maintain that Kashmiri militants regularly cross over to Pakistan through the border and return by the same route after reciving arms training.
Before direct federal rule was imposed today on Jammu-Kashmir state, it was administered temporarily by a governor, a federal representative, since Jan. 18.
Hours later in the same area, troops killed eight militants who slipped across the border from Pakistan, said the officials.
Hindus make up 82 percent of the population.
The action follows the killing Tuesday of at least 29 Moslem militants by Indian security forces.
