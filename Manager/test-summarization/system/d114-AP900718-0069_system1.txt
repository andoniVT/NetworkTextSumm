India and Pakistan have fought two previous wars over Kashmir, in 1948 and 1965.
Indian officials maintain that Kashmiri militants regularly cross over to Pakistan through the border and return by the same route after reciving arms training.
The guards also arrested four militants and seized 14 automatic rifles, two machine guns and two rocket launchers, the officials said.
Hours later in the same area, troops killed eight militants who slipped across the border from Pakistan, said the officials.
Officials, who cannot be identified under briefing rules, said 21 militants were killed in a battle with the Border Security Force in Poonch, 400 miles northwest of New Delhi.
