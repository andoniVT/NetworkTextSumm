On May 20, Miss Ball was to receive an honorary degree from the college and had planned to return to Jamestown, now a city of about 40,000.
Future generations in Celoron will have a reminder of their famous resident every time they drive or walk down the street where she grew up _ it will be renamed Lucy Lane.
Village officials had planned formal ceremonies renaming the street when she was due in the area next month.
After Miss Ball suffered a heart attack last week, residents decided to sign the posters and send them to her as a get-well greeting.
Miss Ball, born 60 miles south of Buffalo in Jamestown on Aug. 6, 1911, grew up in nearby Celoron, a rural hamlet on Chautauqua Lake.
