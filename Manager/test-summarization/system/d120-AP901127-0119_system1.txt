``I am thrilled and delighted that John Major is to succeed me,'' the ``Iron Lady'' said in a statement released by aides.
Major's victory ended a patient, four-year campaign by Heseltine to promote himself as a future leader of the party.
However, he insisted over the weekend, ``I am not running as `Son of Thatcher.'
``Tomorrow always dawns,'' he said, smiling after conceding defeat.
Major and Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd both joined the race, but before the vote her aides spread the word that she was backing Major.
He moved up quickly in the leadership race.
Hurd and Heseltine conceded within minutes, and party officials declared Major elected.
