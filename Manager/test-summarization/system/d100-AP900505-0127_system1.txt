Proceeds are to go to the Spirit Foundation, the charity founded by the Lennons in 1978, two years before Lennon was shot to death in front of his apartment in New York City.
However, the turnout was only 15,000, according to police estimates.
Lennon's widow, Yoko Ono, asked the crowd.
Soul singer Al Green was the opening act.
He was a giving, loving, caring human being.
American actor Christopher Reeve was among the hosts of the concert.
His version of ``All You Need is Love,'' turned into a singalong with the crowd, and Kylie Minogue did ``Help.''
 Thousands of John Lennon fans, some too young to remember the Beatles, swayed and sang along with songs including his anthem ``Imagine'' at a hometown tribute.
