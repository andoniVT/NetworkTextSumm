A crucial first vote of Tory Members of Parliament (MPs) is scheduled for today, and if Heseltine should wrest control of the party from Thatcher -- the longest-serving British head of government in modern times -- she would also have to give up the prime minister's job that she has held since 1979.
Women represented 43 percent of the British labor force in 1988, compared with 40 percent in 1979 when Mrs. Thatcher became prime minister.
 Embattled Margaret Thatcher remains leader of Britain's Conservative Party, and so the country's prime minister -- but only barely.
One woman wrote to The Independent newspaper last week that her 7-year-old daughter wondered what title Mrs. Thatcher's successor would hold, since ``he couldn't be called prime minister, that's a girl's name.''
 Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher today argued passionately during a four-hour meeting that covered subjects ranging from disarmament to reports of Soviet bomber sales to Libya, officials said.
Mrs. Thatcher's popularity is the lowest of any prime minister since opinion polls began in Britain 50 years ago, and senior colleagues have publicly admonished her to change her leadership style following the surprise resignation of her treasury chief, Nigel Lawson.
But the task of the Conservative party, in the year and more that remains before the next general election, must be to rally to enable Mrs. Thatcher to rebuild her personal position, and give her the confidence and support to win the fourth term she deserves."
