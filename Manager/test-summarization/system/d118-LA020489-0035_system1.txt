Called Morally Unfit Tower's personal conduct, however, became an issue in the hearings on Tuesday, when conservative critic Paul Weyrich charged that the former senator was morally unfit for the post because of a history of drinking and womanizing.
Tower's profitable consulting work had raised concerns among a number of members of the Armed Services Committee but did not appear to threaten his nomination.
Tower has said that he was paid a total of more than $750,000 by six defense firms in the two years after leaving government service.
It said that "the speed and greed with which Tower spun through the revolving door (between government and industry) is appalling."
