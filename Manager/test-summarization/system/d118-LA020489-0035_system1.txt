Tower Urged to Withdraw And two influential defense industry trade magazines on Monday will call for Tower to withdraw from consideration for the Pentagon post.
"This whole nomination process is going to present a problem for him at the Pentagon in terms of running the place," Aspin said.
"Everybody kind of wants to get our Cabinet in," the aide said.
It said that "the speed and greed with which Tower spun through the revolving door (between government and industry) is appalling."
The episode allegedly occurred within the last year at the Monocle, a Capitol Hill restaurant frequented by lawmakers, lobbyists and congressional aides.
