Tower, 63 and twice-divorced, served 24 years in the Senate from Texas, including a tenure as chairman of the Armed Services Committee from 1981 to 1984.
The panel hopes to complete its deliberations by the end of this week, Nunn said, and expects to meet once more today to consider Tower's nomination.
"But the facts of the matter are that he has."
It said that "the speed and greed with which Tower spun through the revolving door (between government and industry) is appalling."
None of the 20 passengers or three crew members aboard Atlantic Southeast Airlines Flight 2311 survived.
The episode allegedly occurred within the last year at the Monocle, a Capitol Hill restaurant frequented by lawmakers, lobbyists and congressional aides.
Criticism from Weyrich and other witnesses prompted some committee members to temper the panel's earlier praise for the former Texas senator.
But Weyrich's attack raised anew the issue of Tower's fitness for the job, after two days of testimony last week in which Tower won broad praise from committee members.
Two other allegations under scrutiny by the FBI's special inquiries unit, which is working around the clock this weekend on the Tower matter, involve assertions of another incident of public intoxication and of a recent affair with an unidentified Dallas woman.
