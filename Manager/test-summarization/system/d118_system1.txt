The Senate Armed Services Committee has put the nomination of Tower, a former Texas senator and onetime chairman of the committee, on hold while it takes a second look at Tower's personal habits, including his use of alcohol, and his links to defense contractors.
But Weyrich's attack raised anew the issue of Tower's fitness for the job, after two days of testimony last week in which Tower won broad praise from committee members.
``The nomination of John Tower to be secretary of defense is not confirmed,'' Quayle intoned after the vote.
President-elect Bush designated Tower as his defense secretary on Dec. 16.
After leaving the Senate in 1985, Tower went into business as a defense consultant.
; Tower's death prompted words of grief and praise among his former colleagues on Capitol Hill, even those who helped derail his elevation to the Cabinet in 1989.; "I'm deeply saddened by the loss of John Tower, a tough, able friend and patriot," said Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, who broke ranks with most Democrats to support President Bush's nomination of the 24-year Senate veteran to be defense secretary.
If the new charges should be verified by the FBI, Tower's nomination is doomed, an authoritative committee source said.
