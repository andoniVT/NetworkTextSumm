; Towers death prompted words of grief and praise among his former colleagues on Capitol Hill, even those who helped derail his elevation to the Cabinet in 1989.; Im deeply saddened by the loss of John Tower, a tough, able friend and patriot, said Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, who broke ranks with most Democrats to support President Bushs nomination of the 24-year Senate veteran to be defense secretary.
In written testimony to the Senate panel on Jan. 26, Tower said he could recall no actions in connection with any defense activities in connection with his work for the U.S. subsidiary of British Aerospace, Inc. That statement, according to two publications, The Los Angeles Times and the Legal Times, did not square with information which Tower provided to divorce attorneys working for his second wife in June of 1987.
The Senate panel weighing John Towers nomination to be defense secretary has found a substantial discrepancy in Towers descriptions of his business dealings with a British aircraft and weapons manufacturer, congressional sources said Friday.
The newspaper also said Tower wrecked his car in two early-morning accidents within weeks of one another in 1970, and, two years earlier, he drove into a bicycle ridden by James Patrick Montoya, son of the late Sen. Joseph Montoya, D-N.M., on his way home from work.
