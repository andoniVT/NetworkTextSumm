Brazil called Hirohito ``a superior symbol of the Japanese nation, its culture and its anxieties in a period of drastic transformations in the world and his country and in a time of grave new challenges in the world.''
King Juan Carlos of Spain, King Faisal of Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf monarchs, King Birendra of Nepal and Sultan Mahmood Iskandar of Malaysia also sent condolences to Akihito.
``No one should go to that funeral from this country,'' said Ron Brown, a lawmaker of the opposition Labor Party, who denounced Hirohito as ``a war criminal of the worst kind.''
But opposition lawmakers said Britain should boycott his funeral.
