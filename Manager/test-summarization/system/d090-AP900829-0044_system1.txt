Manila has been rocked by almost daily explosions.
Although no one has claimed responsibility for the blasts, the government has blamed them on former soldiers who have repeatedly tried to toppled Mrs. Aquino in coup attempts.
Communists have accused him of whipping up threats of another coup attempt against Mrs. Aquino so that the civilian leadership would become indebted to him.
Enrile said he was willing to reconcile with Mrs. Aquino, who fired him as defense minister after he was implicated in a coup attempt in November 1986.
The last cease-fire with them collapsed in early 1987.
Sen. Wigberto Tanada called for a truce between the government and the Communist rebels after a major earthquake in the Philippines on July 16, but Mrs. Aquino rejected the proposal.
