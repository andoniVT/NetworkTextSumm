Said Ron Russell, a 16-year member of the congregation: "We brought a good, strong man in here, and -- well, this has ruined him."
Because of that, he said, he plans to extend a medical leave already scheduled to allow for some minor surgery next week and retire a year short of the 10-year tenure that was his goal when he came to St. Cross.
Though at 61 Eales has 11 more years until the diocese would mandate his retirement, he said his doctors told him that "the kind of stress you have been under kills."
"It's kind of like a violin string -- you can only tighten it so far and then it snaps," Eales said Sunday.
