St. Cross was never named as a defendant in the case and neither Eales nor any other official of the venerable seaside church was ever formally charged.
Then, just days after that assistant pastor resigned, the McMartin verdict came down, and, according to several church members, the anonymous phone calls returned.
Though at 61 Eales has 11 more years until the diocese would mandate his retirement, he said his doctors told him that "the kind of stress you have been under kills."
When the then-10-year-old boy's allegation was reported in the local media, other children claimed that they too had been abused at the church.
