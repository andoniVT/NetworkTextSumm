The Ravenscraig had been bound for England, but its destination after its rescue mission was not immediately known.
The Star of Alexandria was built in 1966, and was registered in England.
The C-130 was able to drop a radio into the water near the boat carrying the 23 crew members and they were able to establish communications, Midgett said.
The cause of the sinking was not immediately known, officials said.
``They're all in good shape, some minor cuts and scrapes,'' Midgett said.
Twenty-three crew members were rescued.
The 23 sailors from the Star of Alexandria were found on a lifeboat and picked up by the merchant ship Ravenscraig, Coast Guard Petty Officer Randy Midgett said in New York.
