The Ravenscraig had been bound for England, but its destination after its rescue mission was not immediately known.
The C-130 was able to drop a radio into the water near the boat carrying the 23 crew members and they were able to establish communications, Midgett said.
The Star of Alexandria had been en route from Athens, Greece, to New York with a load of cement when it began taking on water in 12-foot seas and winds up to 35 mph, Midgett said.
``They're all in good shape, some minor cuts and scrapes,'' Midgett said.
It was designed to carry bulk freight, and was owned by Caribene Investments Ltd. of Gibraltar, according to Bureau Veritas, a Paris-based shipping registry.
