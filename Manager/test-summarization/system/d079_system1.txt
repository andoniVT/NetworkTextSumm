 Gilbert, an ``extremely dangerous hurricane'' and one of the strongest storms in history, roared toward Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula Tuesday with 175 mph winds after battering the Dominican Republic, Jamaica and the tiny Cayman Islands.
Gilbert was downgraded to a tropical storm at 6 a.m. EDT as it proceeded 50 miles southeast of the city of Monterrey in northern Mexico, said Noel Rishnychok, a meteorologist with the National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla.
Only two Category 5 hurricanes have hit the United States _ the 1935 storm that killed 408 people in Florida and Hurricane Camille, which devastated the Mississippi coast in 1969 and killed 256 people.

Hurricane Gilbert, which has left nearly one in four Jamaicans homeless, slackened somewhat as it swirled over land, but the storm was beginning to gain strength over open water as it moved toward the U.S. Gulf Coast with sustained winds of 120 mph.
