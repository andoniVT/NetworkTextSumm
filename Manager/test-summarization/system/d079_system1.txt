With tropical storm force winds extending 250 miles north and 200 miles south of the hurricane's center, Gilbert also was one of the largest.
Gilbert was downgraded to a tropical storm at 6 a.m. EDT as it proceeded 50 miles southeast of the city of Monterrey in northern Mexico, said Noel Rishnychok, a meteorologist with the National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla.
 With the winds of Hurricane Gilbert clocked at 175 miles per hour, U.S. weather officials called Gilbert the most intense hurricane ever recorded in the Western Hemisphere.
The center said Hurricane Gilbert was the most intense storm on record in terms of barometric pressure.
