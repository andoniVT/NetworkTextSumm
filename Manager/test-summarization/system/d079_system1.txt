Gilbert was downgraded to a tropical storm at 6 a.m. EDT as it proceeded 50 miles southeast of the city of Monterrey in northern Mexico, said Noel Rishnychok, a meteorologist with the National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla.
The National Weather Service in San Juan, Puerto Rico, said Gilbert was moving westward at 15 mph with a broad area of cloudiness and heavy weather rotating around the center of the storm.
The hurricane center said Gilbert at one point was the most intense storm on record in terms of barometric pressure, which was measured Tuesday at 26.13 inches, breaking the 26.35 inches recorded for the 1935 hurricane that devastated the Florida Keys.
Camilles storm surge was 25 feet high, but the hurricane center was forecasting a surge of only 8-12 feet for Gilbert, Zimmer said.
But by this morning, the once massive storms maximum sustained winds had flagged to 65 mph, nine less than hurricane strength, and forecasters said the eye had all but disappeared.
The eye of 450-mile-wide hurricane, with 120 mph winds, crossed onto land at 5:35 p.m. EDT, sweeping ashore in a sparsely populated area 120 miles south of Brownsville, Texas, weather reports said.
Gilberts remnants should bring very heavy rains to Rio Grande valley before heading north up the Mississippi River Valley as a huge rain-making machine, said Mark Zimmer, meteorologist at the National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla. The danger of flash flooding in Texas is very great, Zimmer said.
