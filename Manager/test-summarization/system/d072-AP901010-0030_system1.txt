Bernstein was the wunderkind of American music at a time when all respected conductors in the United States were born and trained in Europe.
In May, he canceled plans to conduct opening night of the Spoleto Festival in Charleston, S.C., citing ``a near brush with pneumonia.''
Bernstein was once a heavy smoker.
He has conducted 1,244 New York Philharmonic concerts, more than any other conductor.
After Boston Symphony Orchestra conductor Serge Koussevitzky died in 1951, Bernstein became head of the orchestra and conducting departments at Tanglewood.
The 72-year-old maestro suffers from a lung tumor, emphysema and pulmonary infections and has been told by his doctor to stop conducting and performing on the piano, his spokeswoman said Tuesday.
