; Marketing an icon; Since his death in 1980, Ono has steadily kept Lennon products coming out: the albums "Milk and Honey" and "Menlove Avenue" and the 4-CD boxed set "The John Lennon Collection"; the book "Skywriting by Word of Mouth," a collection of Lennon's unpublished writings; Lennon's art, which Ono says was his main interest in his final years; and Lennon-inspired merchandise, such as a line of John Lennon eyeglasses.
"; Many of the books that have been written about Lennon and the Beatles, especially Albert Goldman's loathing portrait of Lennon, have been painful to Ono.
 When celebrity biographer Albert Goldman began digging into ``The Lives of John Lennon,'' his first move was to mail a long, reverential request for help to Yoko Ono.
Cynthia and John's son, Julian Lennon, also denounced the book on the radio taping, calling it ``lies, untruths,'' and adding that ``the whole thing is just sickening.''
All of which indicates why "The Lives of John Lennon" is such a wretched book: not because it makes a good man look bad, but because it shows no other purpose than to make a man -- whether a good man or a bad one, we laymen will probably never know -- look bad.
