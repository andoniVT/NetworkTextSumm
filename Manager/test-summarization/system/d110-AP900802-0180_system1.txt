Kuwait, an oil-rich city-state, has 1.9 million residents _ 60 percent foreigners _ and an army of 20,300 soldiers.
THE FORCES: Iraq, a country of more than 17 million, has the Arab world's most battle-trained army, and had massed more than 100,000 soldiers on the Kuwaiti border.
He froze Iraq's assets in the United States and blocked almost all Iraqi imports, including oil.
Early Friday, the invaders controlled Kuwait city, the capital.
Diplomatic sources estimate more than 200 Kuwaitis were killed or wounded, mainly from the Emiri Guard which bore the main brunt of the invasion.
The Soviets also condemned the invasion and stopped arms sales to Iraq.
