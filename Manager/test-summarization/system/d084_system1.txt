 A fiery explosion in a giant gun turret rocked the refitted battleship Iowa on maneuvers in the Atlantic today, killing at least 47 sailors and injuring an undetermined number, the Pentagon said.
But the Navy defended the 16-inch gun, the mightiest in use on any ocean, after an explosion killed 47 sailors Wednesday aboard the battleship Iowa while a turret crew loaded gunpowder for target practice.
The Pentagon said the blast ripped through the middle gun of the three-gun turret, and that that gun had not been fired prior to the explosion.
James Cudler, a Pentagon spokesman, said the explosion occurred as an Iowa officer was making a videotape to record the firing of the ship's big guns.
The explosion came after two of the three guns had been loaded and just after the crew had been given permission to load and fire the center gun, the newspaper said.

Naval officers familiar with the Iowa said an explosion can occur if a gun breech is cracked, but Seaquist stressed, ``we simply do not know what caused that powder to go.''
