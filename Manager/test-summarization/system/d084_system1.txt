The Navy said Thursday that none of the guns in the Iowa turret had been fired before the explosion took place.
But the Navy defended the 16-inch gun, the mightiest in use on any ocean, after an explosion killed 47 sailors Wednesday aboard the battleship Iowa while a turret crew loaded gunpowder for target practice.
James Cudler, a Pentagon spokesman, said the explosion occurred as an Iowa officer was making a videotape to record the firing of the ships big guns.
The bodies of 47 sailors killed in the gun explosion on the Iowa arrived in the United States on Thursday as the Navy tried to figure out what caused the battleships turret to blow up.
A fiery explosion in a giant gun turret rocked the refitted battleship Iowa on maneuvers in the Atlantic today, killing at least 47 sailors and injuring an undetermined number, the Pentagon said.
There were 11 survivors inside the turret, all on the lowest deck where they were loading powder from the ships magazines, the Navy said.
As Navy officials continued their inquiry into the explosion, sailors aboard the Wisconsin, sister ship to the Iowa, opened their ship Saturday in Norfolk, Va., to talk about their pride in battleships and the sense of loss.
