Kohl said that his talks with Gorbachev -- who told him that reunification is a matter for the Germans themselves to decide -- could lead to an economic breakthrough in East Germany, which in turn could provide a push forward for all of Europe.
According to Tass, the Soviet leader said any action on reunification must not infringe on the interests of either East or West Germany, the four Allied powers: France, Britain, the United States or the Soviet Union, or anyone else in Europe.
Count Otto Lambsdorff, head of West Germanys Free Democratic Party, a partner in the governing coalition, said Tuesday in London that Gorbachev has adopted a more positive attitude toward German reunification.
Skubiszewski faulted West German Chancellor Helmut Kohls program for gradual German reunification, offered last week, for not making clear that reunification would respect the existing border between Poland and East Germany.
He also said German reunification is unlikely as long as West Germany belongs to NATO and East Germany to the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact military alliance.
There is growing discussion in West Germany about German reunification as a result of sweeping social and political reforms underway in East Germany.
But Soviet affairs expert William Hyland says that despite these assertions, a reunified Germany is really terrifying to most of the countries involved, to the West Germans, to the United States, Soviet Union, Poland and Czechoslovakia.
