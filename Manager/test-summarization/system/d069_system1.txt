He was one of several experts in German history discussing the implications of reunification following the decision Tuesday by the four World War II allies _ the United States, Britain, France and the Soviet Union _ to accept the reunification of a Germany they divided 45 years ago.
 The mass emigration of thousands of disaffected East Germans has rekindled reunification talk in West Germany, where some legislators plan to begin exploring the possiblity of reuniting the two Germanys.
According to Tass, the Soviet leader said any action on reunification must not infringe on the interests of either East or West Germany, the four Allied powers: France, Britain, the United States or the Soviet Union, or anyone else in Europe.
``The fears are real because those who bear the scars of the last `unified Germany' do not see their concerns being addressed in the current reunification discussions betwen world leaders.''
During the past few weeks, both Germanys have increased business and cultural ties but have debated what labels to use for closer relations, since the East Berlin government rejects calls for reunification.
``The only alternative to reunification,'' added Turner, is an East Germany in ruins, ``a basket case, a Bangladesh of Europe.''
He said he agreed with Gorbachev that reunification must be decided not only by East and West Germany, but all of Europe.
