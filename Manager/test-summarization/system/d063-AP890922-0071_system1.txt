Three people died later and a total of 51 were injured in the bombings.
In July 1982, eight soldiers died in IRA bombings near the Household Cavalry barracks at Knightsbridge in central London and at a bandstand in the capital's Regent's Park where an army band was playing.
About 60 soldiers narrowly escaped death or injury in February when they were evacuated from their barracks in Shropshire, western England, just before a bomb exploded.
One soldier was killed and nine wounded in an IRA attack on an army barracks in north London in August 1988.
Military targets on the British mainland have been attacked several times by the Irish Republican Army in the past year as part of its campaign to rid Northern Ireland of British rule.
