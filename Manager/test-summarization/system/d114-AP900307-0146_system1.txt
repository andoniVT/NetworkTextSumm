A joint statement after the meeting said ``despite their ideological and political differences, (the parties) were one in defending the unity and integrity of the country,'' the news agency reported.
Jagmohan said the truck was driving around Srinagar distributing food to troops on street corners when it was blown up by Moslem militants.
``We are going to hit hard at anti-national elements, there is no way they can get away with what they are doing,'' Jagmohan said.
Pakistan protested, claiming the territory because of its predominantly Moslem population.
He gave no further details of the attack.
Nationwide, Moslems make up 12 percent of India's 880 million people and Hindus account for 82 percent.
