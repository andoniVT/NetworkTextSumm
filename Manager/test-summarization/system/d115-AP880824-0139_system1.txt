The government hospital in Dharan treated hundreds of people injured when brick and wood houses collapsed.
Michael Hamilton, an official at the British Embassy in Katmandu, said three medical teams had been sent to Dharan.
Ambassador John Gunther Dean presented the government with a similar amount for Indian victims.
No further damage was reported in the city, where 100 houses collapsed during the quake.
Elroy J. Carlson, an official at the U.S. Embassy in Katmandu, said the United State offered $25,000 in aid.
In eastern India, which also was devastated by the quake, cracks were found in the embankments of six rivers in Bihar state, and officials said floods could pose the next threat to the 10 million people.
