This year's six nominees were chosen Thursday from 102 books considered by a panel headed by David Lodge, a British literary critic and novelist who was nominated for the prize last year for his book, ``Nice Work.''
Rushdie, a British citizen, has been in hiding since Feb. 14 when the late Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini ordered he be killed for allegedly blaspheming Islam in ``Satanic Verses.''
Rushdie was nominated for the prize last year but it was won by Australian author Peter Carey for his love story ``Oscar and Lucinda.''
``We expect more interest in this year's Booker Prize than ever before, partly thanks to last year's controversy over Salman Rushdie's `Satanic Verses,''' Sharpe said.
