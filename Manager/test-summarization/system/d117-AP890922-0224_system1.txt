Ishiguro, previously nominated for the award, ``was beaten as the Booker favorite in 1986, which makes his chances that much stronger this time in our view,'' said William Hill spokesman Graham Sharpe.
``We expect more interest in this year's Booker Prize than ever before, partly thanks to last year's controversy over Salman Rushdie's `Satanic Verses,''' Sharpe said.
The award, to be announced Oct. 26, carries a $31,600 prize funded by the Booker McConnell food company.
Oddsmaker William Hill gave 7-to-4 odds on Ishiguro's novel about a butler's travels through Britain's West Country and said it was ``a firm favorite'' to win.
