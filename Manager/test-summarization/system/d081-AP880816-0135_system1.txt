On Aug. 16, 1980, workers at factories around the northern port of Gdansk joined striking shipyard workers to form Solidarity, the first and only independent trade federation in the Soviet bloc.
Solidarity was crushed in 1981, when the government imposed martial law, and was banned nearly a year later by parliament.
Three members of Solidarity were barred Saturday from working.
The workers are also calling for higher wages and better working conditions, and are requesting two lawyers and two economists to assist them in the negotiations.
She said security officers blocked miners on the afternoon shift, which starts at 2 p.m., from entering the grounds to join the striking miners.
