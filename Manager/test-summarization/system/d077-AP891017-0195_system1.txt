A 7 reading is a ``major'' earthquake, capable of widespread heavy damage; 8 is a ``great'' quake, capable of tremendous damage.
An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage, 6 severe damage.
Thus a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times stronger than one of 6.5.
The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on seismographs.
The quake knocked out phones and power, including electricity at The Associated Press' bureau in San Francisco.
The quake shook buildings in Sacramento, 95 miles to the northeast, and was felt as far away as Reno, Nev., 225 miles to the east.
