Gordon first met Miss Ball in 1947 on the radio program ``My Favorite Husband,'' which later became ``I Love Lucy'' on television.
The next six years saw him as Harrison Carter on ``Here's Lucy.''
``I personally will remember her as the best talent of her kind in the world ... a wonderful, warm friend and a bit of a genius _ the only one I've ever really known.''
``She would be the first one to scream her head off if I did that.''
Gordon, who is appearing in a play in Edmonton, spent the day in an Edmonton hotel room, mourning the death of Lucille Ball in a Los Angeles hospital Wednesday at age 77 and quietly remembering his funny friend.
