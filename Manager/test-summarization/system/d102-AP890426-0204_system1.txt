The play has another month to run and Gordon says that means he won't be able to attend Miss Ball's funeral.
He is currently appearing with that company's Mayfair Dinner Theatre as a priest in the play ``Mass Appeal.''
Gordon has done regular stints for years at a chain of Edmonton-based dinner theatres called Stage West.
Gordon last spoke to Miss Ball from Edmonton on his birthday, Feb. 20, when ``she called to wish me a happy birthday as she has done for years and years.''
