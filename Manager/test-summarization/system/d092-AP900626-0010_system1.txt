After the June 4, 1989, military crackdown on the democracy movement, Fang and Li obtained refuge in the U.S. Embassy.
In between, in 1966, he was a victim of the Cultural Revolution purges and was sent to a communal farm for ``re-education.''
In 1987, he was fired from his Hefei university posts.
Fang was expelled from the Communist Party in 1957, when he said Marxist theory on physics was obsolete.
His speeches to students at the University of Science and Technology in Hefei in central China, where he was vice president, helped incite the protests, party hard-liners said.
POLITICAL DISSENT: Fang became politically prominent during the pro-democracy student demonstrations of 1986-87.
