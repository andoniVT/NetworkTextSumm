Comrade Wen Jiabao fully affirmed the initial victories that the two cities have scored in their flood fighting and relief work under the leadership of the provincial party committee and government.
As the highest flood season has not yet arrived, we should be prepared at any time to meet new flood peaks head-on rather than slacken our efforts.
This fully shows that, with party leadership and the socialist system, we will be able to overcome all difficulties.
 Comrade Wen Jiabao [member of CPC Central Committee Secretariat] and his party left Changsha for Zhuzhou and Xiangtan yesterday.
In the next step, we should earnestly draw a lesson from this negative experience.
