Glen Ellis, a Red Cross official, estimated that 18,000 residents in Charleston and the three surrounding counties headed for shelters.
Since then several big storms have threatened but veered away, and officials were worried that Charlestonians wouldn't heed Hugo's warnings.
``We've had so many close calls,'' said Gary Garnet, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service.
The storm, which caused billions in damage, claimed 17 lives in South Carolina, and only two were in the Charleston area, which bore the brunt of Hugo's 135 mph winds.
 Residents took forecasters at their word when they warned of Hurricane Hugo's fury, and the low number of deaths from the powerful storm can be credited to this healthy respect, authorities said.
