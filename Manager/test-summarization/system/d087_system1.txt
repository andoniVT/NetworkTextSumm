What the relays demonstrate more clearly than any other athletics event is that at the Olympics the race has traditionally gone to affluent countries - or to those, rather, that choose to lavish resources on athletes.
Host South Korea rose to fourth in the world with 12 golds.
Noureddine Morcelli of Algeria will be hard to beat in the men's 1,500m.
It was exacerbated by NBC's coverage, which the Koreans saw as anti-Korean and insensitive to local culture; the arrest of several American athletes; and the perceived rudeness of the U.S. team at the opening ceremony.
In the 4x100m heats James Jett replaced Carl Lewis but Lewis ran impressively in last night's semi-final and tonight will pursue his eighth Olympic gold.
But catching Johnson and expelling him and nine other athletes with positive drug tests was an indication that ``we have won the battle against doping,'' Samaranch said.
American athletes tended to isolate themselves.
Two of the six were gold medals, won by Brian Boitano in figure skating and Bonnie Blair in speed skating.
``There have been high points and some low points, and the most important low point was Ben Johnson,'' Juan Antonio Samaranch, president of the International Olympic Committee, said today.
