Space shuttle Discovery trailed 57 miles behind the telescope and was to stay nearby until the Hubble's aperture door was opened, set for Friday morning.
For scientists, and then the rest of us, all that becomes possible now that the space shuttle Discovery has carried the Hubble Space Telescope into the sky to see what no one has seen before.
The space shuttle Discovery, which carried the telescope to orbit, was 50 miles behind the telescope, ready to lend a hand if needed.
The team at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, which guides the telescope, said the door-opening motion jarred the telescope more than had been expected and that the system reacted properly in shutting down.
 Discovery's astronauts overcame balky equipment to send the Hubble Space Telescope floating free from the shuttle today on a 15-year quest for secrets of the universe.
When the door covering the telescope aperture is opened, starlight will strike the telescope's finely polished 94.5-inch mirror for the first time.
The Hubble telescope, delayed by technical problems and the 1986 Challenger accident, has waited seven years to take its place in space.
 Two weeks after a failed launch attempt, an improved Discovery is ready to embark on one of the most momentous shuttle missions, hoisting the Hubble Space Telescope high enough to behold the threshold of time.
