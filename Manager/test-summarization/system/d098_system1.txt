I've been with the program since it was a concept.
 Seven years late, the Hubble Space Telescope is where it belongs, out of this world and in search of others so distant that they may have been formed at the beginning of time.
Hubble provided the basis for the big-bang theory of creation.
NASA launch commentator George Diller exulted as the Discovery rose off its seaside launch pad.
Hawley's job on Wednesday will be to drop the telescope overboard for a 15-year stay in space.
While it remained on Earth, the telescope cost $7 million a month to exercise and keep in readiness.
The telescope is 43 feet long and 14 feet in diameter, about the size of a railroad tank car.
The Hubble is expected to help provide the answer to two major questions: How old is the universe?
In the cargo bay, the telescope receives electrical power from the shuttle.
At the sign of life, applause and cheers erupted in Mission Control in Houston.
With 31 seconds left in the countdown, the computer that runs the final moments before liftoff refused to close a fuel valve and stopped the launch process.
The mission was delayed another two weeks when a faulty power unit on Discovery forced the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to halt the first launch attempt four minutes before April 10's scheduled liftoff.
