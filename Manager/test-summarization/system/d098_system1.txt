Discoverys astronauts overcame balky equipment to send the Hubble Space Telescope floating free from the shuttle today on a 15-year quest for secrets of the universe.
Five astronauts boarded Discovery today for a second try at sending the Hubble Space Telescope into orbit to scan the outermost reaches of the universe for clues to the beginning of time.
The theory of an expanding universe supported the belief that the universe originated in a cosmic explosion and that all matter is still rushing from the site of that so-called Big Bang.
The telescope, named for the late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, will enable astronomers over its 15-year working lifetime to look back 14 billion years and possibly determine the age of the universe.
It is expected to provide clues to the age and size of the universe, and it may solve the mysteries of quasars, pulsars and black holes and even find stars with planets that could conceivably support life.
After years of delay and a last-minute snag, the Hubble Space Telescope was freed from the shuttle Discovery on Wednesday and, glinting in the sunlight, drifted into orbit on its 15-year search for new worlds.
His work gave rise to the Big Bang theory that the universe was created by a tremendous explosion.
