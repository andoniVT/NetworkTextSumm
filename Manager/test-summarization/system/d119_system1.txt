 The Senate Foreign Relations Committee today endorsed the nomination of Michigan Republican activist Peter F. Secchia as ambassador to Italy, but the panel's chairman said he feared Secchia might ``embarrass the United States'' because of his ``penchant for making gross remarks.''
Mrs. Newman served as chairman of the Washington state Bush for President committee.
``I believe that this nomination is a mistake, and in all likelihood Mr. Secchia will be an embarrasment to the administration and the United States,'' Pell said.
Davis, a former State Department consultant and former ambassador to Paraguay, was sent to Panama by President Reagan in 1986.
One of a lengthy and growing list of Bush supporters and contributors named to diplomatic posts, Gildenhorn gave $100,000 during the 1988 presidential campaign to the Republican National State Elections Committee.
Word of the expected nomination came as Bush's choice to be assistant secretary of state for Latin America, Democratic political consultant Bernard Aronson, ran into objections from several Republican members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, congressional aides said.
Twenty of 29 ambassadorial nomination made by Bush in the first six months of his administration have gone to non-professionals, many of them large contributors to Republican causes, committee sources said.
