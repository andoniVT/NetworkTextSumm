Earlier this month an IRA gunman shot to death an army wife, Heidi Hazell, 25, in her car near her home at Dortmund.
There has been a series of bomb and automatic rifle attacks this year on British soldiers and their families stationed in West Germany.
Eleven bandsmen and mounted guards were killed in those incidents.
Friday's attack was the worst on the mainland since the virtually simultaneous bombings of July, 1982, directed at ceremonial military units in London's Hyde Park and Regent's Park.
The statement was signed "P. O'Neill, Irish Republican Publicity Bureau," a signature that has appeared on earlier IRA bombing claims.
