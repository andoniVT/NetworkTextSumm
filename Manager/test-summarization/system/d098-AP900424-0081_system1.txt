Ed Weiler, NASA program scientist for Hubble, said watching the liftoff was ``a double whammy'' because ``it was my first shuttle launch and the launch of the HST.
There were times when we were elated'' about Hubble's progress, said William H. Jeffreys, a University of Texas astronomer and Hubble's astrometry project leader.
Only a few dozen of them returned Tuesday, but they were just as excited.
Two weeks ago when hundreds of scientists crowded into the Kennedy Space Center, the launch was scrubbed four minutes before liftoff.
The $1.5 billion telescope originally was scheduled for launch in 1983 but remained grounded by technical problems and the Challenger explosion.
