The leadership's decision inspired widespread press criticism and a demonstration at the academy's Moscow headquarters.
That would force the academy to start over and produce a new list of nominees under terms of the new election law.
Those in the academy who support Sakharov hope to force a new round of nominations by mustering enough support to deny all nominees a majority, said Andrei Mironov, a former political prisoner.
The other 1,500 will be filled by representatives of the 15 Soviet republics and their electoral districts.
Sakharov was nominated from several geographic districts for a seat in the new 2,250-member Congress of People's Deputies, but he decided to refuse the nominations and fight for an Academy of Sciences seat.
