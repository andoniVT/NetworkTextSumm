Sakharov and several other well-known proponents of reform are missing from the list.
That would force the academy to start over and produce a new list of nominees under terms of the new election law.
The 67-year-old nuclear physicist and human rights activist, who won the Nobel in 1975, said in a speech to the academy that many scientists objected to the slate for Sunday's election approved by the leadership in January.
The leadership's decision inspired widespread press criticism and a demonstration at the academy's Moscow headquarters.
The official news agency Tass quoted him as saying, however, that scientists were upset ``not because Sakharov was not nominated, but because the role of scientific institutions was ignored.''
