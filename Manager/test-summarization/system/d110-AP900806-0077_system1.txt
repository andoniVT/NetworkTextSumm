Kuwaiti diplomats said they were all Iraqis, including a son-in-law of Saddam, a charge official Iraqi media denied.
No photographs of the named leaders have been shown and 12 reporters brought to Kuwait by the Ministry of Information could not locate any of them.
The nine-member Kuwaiti military government, announced by Iraq on Saturday, remained a mystery.
The force comprises about 80,000 troops, mostly Iraqis.
Diplomats in the region said a new Kuwaiti army fanned out through Kuwait.
But thousands of Iraqi soldiers remained behind in Kuwait, controlling major government buildings, commerical centers and ports.
At a border checkpoint 30 miles south of the Iraqi port city of Basra, dozens of tanks, armored personnel carriers and trucks carrying hundreds of soldiers crossed back into Iraq on Sunday.
