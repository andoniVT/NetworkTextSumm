But the finance minister is backing Sebi to the hilt and singled it out for praise in his recent budget speech.
It was established by Mr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister, as a crucial element in financial reform.
This week's argument is only the latest in a series of disputes which began almost as soon as Sebi started operations a year ago.
Foreign investors, who are being wooed by India as a source of much-needed capital, will also be concerned at the latest allegations of poor management at the exchange.
The argument will do nothing to restore investors' faith in the stock market where, as measured by the Bombay stock exchange's 30-share index, shares have fallen 48 per cent from their peak early last year, including a 320 points fall since the government's budget was announced two weeks ago.
