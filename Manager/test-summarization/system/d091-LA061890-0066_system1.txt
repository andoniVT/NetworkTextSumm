Eighteen Ohio counties have been declared federal disaster areas since tornadoes and flooding first struck May 25.
As rescue efforts continued, the National Guard cleared roads and bridges leading into the stricken area.
The debris broke loose, and that's when we got three big gushes of water," he said.
"Eventually the bridges couldn't hold any more.
The "dams" broke under the water pressure.
Badia said rainwater running down hillsides forced debris into the creeks, forming dams at each bridge.
Investigators Sunday blamed the flash floods on an unusually heavy rainstorm that overwhelmed the designed flow capacities of three bridges over the creeks.
