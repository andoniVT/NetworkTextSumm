Discovery's replacement auxiliary power unit was successfully test fired Wednesday and the battery charging for the telescope was completed Thursday, one day ahead of schedule.
Columbia's 3.5-mile trip to the firing stand was set to begin at 8 a.m. today.
"We're off and running," NASA spokesman George Diller said.
Five hours later, Discovery's five-member crew was scheduled to fly in from the Johnson Space Center in Houston to make final preparations for launch.
Engineers also readied the shuttle Columbia for rollout to its launch pad today for a May flight.
"We're still 80% go for launch weather-wise."
Discovery's carefully scripted countdown began on time at 3 p.m.
