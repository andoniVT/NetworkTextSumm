Eggers, meanwhile, acknowledged that there was ``no question'' that Tower sometimes drank too much in the early 1970s, but he said: ``He is not an alcoholic.
On Friday, Tower authorized the release of a statement that recent hospital tests showed no evidence of alcohol abuse, and Vice President Dan Quayle said, ``I have never seen drinking being a factor in John Tower's life other than a social glass of wine.''
FBI spokesman Bill Carter refused comment on specifics of the Tower investigation, but said ``We will follow any lead.''
The youth was not seriously hurt.
The newspaper also said Tower wrecked his car in two early-morning accidents within weeks of one another in 1970, and, two years earlier, he drove into a bicycle ridden by James Patrick Montoya, son of the late Sen. Joseph Montoya, D-N.M., on his way home from work.
