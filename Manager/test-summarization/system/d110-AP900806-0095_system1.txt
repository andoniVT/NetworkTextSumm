The provisional government said countries ``have to remember they have interests and citizens in Kuwait.''
In a statement carried by the Iraqi News Agency on Sunday, the Iraqi-installed military government of Kuwait warned other nations not to take ``punishing measures'' against it or Iraq.
The Soviet Union and China said they would halt arms shipments to Iraq.
The vote followed similar sanctions imposed on Iraq by much of the West, including the United States, Japan and the European Community.
The United Nations has no enforcement mechanism but later could call on members to take military action against Iraq or impose a blockade.
