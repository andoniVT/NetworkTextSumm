It was not known if the radio had been discovered by the Iraqis or shut down by the Saudis to avoid provoking Iraqi President Saddam Hussein at a time when fears were being expressed that he might invade Saudi Arabia as well.
The six states issued a statement saying, ``We strongly condemn and are very sorry for this attack that one Arab state took against another Arab state.
The only direct Saudi statement since the invasion was made by an anonymous government spokesman through the official Saudi Press Agency the day after the Iraqi move.
It broadcast calls for resistance to the Iraqis.
