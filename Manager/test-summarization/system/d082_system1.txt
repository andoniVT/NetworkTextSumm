However, Sakharov has insisted on speedier progress in improving the Soviet record on human rights, and during a Jan. 15 meeting in the Kremlin, he handed Gorbachev a list of 200 people he said were imprisoned for their views.
This weeks issue of the newspaper Moscow News said that Sakharov long ago understood the need for change in the Soviet Union.
The first three days of this week may become the hottest spring days for Soviet scientists, it said, alluding to the leaderships rejection of such reformers as Sakharov, space scientist Roald Sagdeev and sociologist Tatyana Zaslavsakaya.
Soviet human rights activist Andrei D. Sakharov said Sunday that his country is on the brink of economic catastrophe because reforms of the old centralized system are too slow in arriving.
Four pages were filled with pictures of him, condolence telegrams from exiled writer Alexander Solzhenitsyn and President Bush and a text of Sakharovs last public remarks, a speech he delivered hours before his death in which he said the Soviet hierarchy was leading the country to a catastrophe.
That report from Radio Moscow, carried on its international-service news programs Tuesday, apparently was the only mention made by Soviet media of Sakharovs visit to the United States, which began Sunday.
