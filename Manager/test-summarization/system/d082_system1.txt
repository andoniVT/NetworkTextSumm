While Sakharov was in exile in the closed city of Gorky, the author of a book that accused him of leading a luxurious and scandal-ridden existence came to ask for an interview, Moscow News said.
A vote on the academy candidates is scheduled for Tuesday.
Crimean Tatars and Jewish refuseniks _ two of the groups Sakharov helped _ joined rank-and-file Communists, teachers and engineers in filing past the body of the physicist, Nobel Peace Prize winner, human rights advocate and legislator.
So many people wanted to see Sakharov's body lying in state that authorities extended the viewing period by four hours and moved the coffin so two rows of mourners could file past.
A son and daughter from his first marriage and son and daughter of Bonner also attended, along with four grandchildren.
One man, Sergei Kosykh, brought his 7-year-old daughter along.
Bonner, Sakharov's constant companion and fellow human rights activist, sat closest to the coffin, clutching a black handbag and periodically closing her eyes.
one elderly woman cried out as she saw Sakharov's body in an open coffin, sloping to the floor of the beige marble Youth Palace in central Moscow.
Unofficial shrines sprouted outside Sakharov's southeast Moscow apartment, where candles flickered alongside his portrait.
