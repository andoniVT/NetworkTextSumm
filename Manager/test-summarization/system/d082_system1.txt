 Andrei D. Sakharov urged members of the Academy of Sciences on Monday to reject the leadership's list of candidates for the new Soviet legislature, which does not include the Nobel Peace Prize winner.
Since then, Sakharov, who was one of the creators of his nation's hydrogen bomb, has vocally supported Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reform campaign, but has called for the liberation of all political prisoners and more improvements in the field of human rights.
Gorbachev called Sakharov in Gorky in December 1986 and told him he could return to Moscow.
This week's issue of the newspaper Moscow News said that Sakharov long ago understood the need for change in the Soviet Union.
Gorbachev, who freed the physicist from seven years of internal exile, called Sakharov a "man of conviction and sincerity."
 Soviet human rights activist Andrei D. Sakharov said Sunday that his country is on the brink of economic catastrophe because reforms of the old centralized system are too slow in arriving.
Sakharov, 68, died Thursday night in his study, just hours after urging fellow members of the Congress of People's Deputies to create a formal opposition to the party in their drive to break its seven-decade strangehold on political power.
