Gorbachev called Sakharov in Gorky in December 1986 and told him he could return to Moscow.
The obituary noted Sakharov was exiled in the industrial city of Gorky about 250 miles east of Moscow from 1980 to 1986.
Gorbachev, who freed the physicist from seven years of internal exile, called Sakharov a "man of conviction and sincerity."
Sakharov has been quoted numerous times by Soviet media since his return from exile, but the article in Moscow News was the longest devoted to him so far.
In Strasbourg, France, the 518-member European Parliament unanimously paid tribute to Sakharov, whose name it had given to its Human Rights Prize.
 Andrei D. Sakharov urged members of the Academy of Sciences on Monday to reject the leadership's list of candidates for the new Soviet legislature, which does not include the Nobel Peace Prize winner.
Ligachev, interviewed by the Tass news agency on Friday, had said he disagreed with Sakharov but respected him.
Radio Moscow said Sakharov made the comments about the Reagan administration's space-based anti-missile program at a Boston news conference.
The official news agency Tass quoted him as saying, however, that scientists were upset ``not because Sakharov was not nominated, but because the role of scientific institutions was ignored.''
