``Gross injustices were permitted in relation to A.D. Sakharov,'' it said.
The attempt to prevent Sakharov from running for a revamped Soviet Parliament has outraged Soviet intellectuals.
Bush said that "all of us are diminished" and that Sakharov "embodied all of what is good and decent in the human spirit."
A middle-aged woman drew from Russian literature to reflect on Sakharov's contributions.
``Working on the creation of weapons of mass destruction, A.D. Sakharov understood early the danger for humanity of their wide production and testing, and stubbornly placed before the government the question of limiting such tests,'' it said.
Sakharov, however, used the occasion to outline his hopes for a multiparty system, public control over the KGB security police, and the convergence of communism and capitalism.
Sakharov, wearing a blue beret and plaid scarf, made no statement as he left the reception and entered a waiting limousine.
It reported that when the unidentified author refused, Sakharov said, ``It's too bad that duels are abolished in our times,'' and slapped him.
Begun and Slepak said they would lay a wreath on Sakharov's grave in Sharansky's name.
