Since then, Sakharov, who was one of the creators of his nation's hydrogen bomb, has vocally supported Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reform campaign, but has called for the liberation of all political prisoners and more improvements in the field of human rights.
Gorbachev was expected to pay his last respects Monday, when the funeral is planned, and on Sunday was represented by Yevgeny M. Primakov, chairman of the funeral commission and a non-voting member of the country's ruling Politburo.
A mound of red and white carnations grew steadily at Sakharov's feet, and a spotlight was focused on a portrait showing Sakharov with his hands over his mouth, deep in thought.
There were signs of grief throughout this snowy capital of 9 million people, as though a government leader had died.
The huge line of mourners, sometimes four deep and heavily bundled against below-zero temperatures, stretched a mile from the palace and poured continuously out of a subway station.
Four pages were filled with pictures of him, condolence telegrams from exiled writer Alexander Solzhenitsyn and President Bush and a text of Sakharov's last public remarks, a speech he delivered hours before his death in which he said the Soviet hierarchy was ``leading the country to a catastrophe.''
