Underground reports described strikes that were of much shorter and not as widespread as those in Kuznetsk and Donetsk.
Until Gorbachev came to power in 1985, the official media did not report job actions in the Soviet Union.
Records from that period are sketchy, but fighting was widespread and industrial production was severely disrupted.
The strikes are believed to be the nation's worst since the 1920s, when the country was gripped in revolution, civil war and a power struggle.
A spokesman for the strike committee in Prokopyevsk, Valery Legachev, said Tuesday that Slyunkov ``promised to increase the area's regular food supplies by 20 to 30 percent, as well as soap and washing powder.''
