Records from that period are sketchy, but fighting was widespread and industrial production was severely disrupted.
Underground reports described strikes that were of much shorter and not as widespread as those in Kuznetsk and Donetsk.
If the strike spreads to other sectors of the economy, ``We may have to take such extreme measures that it will hurt what we've been doing,'' Gorbachev said, without specifying what steps he would take.
The Politburo sent to Kuznetsk Nikolai N. Slyunkov, a member of the ruling Communist Party body who worked several years in the tractor-building industry and has spoken about labor discipline.
Tass carried a report Tuesday denying that the Soviet Union's third major coal region, Karaganda in Kazakhstan, also was on strike.
