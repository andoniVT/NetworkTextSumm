The release of renin is the first step in a rapid chemical chain reaction that raises blood pressure.
The results, published in this week's New England Journal of Medicine, lend strong support to Dr. Laragh's theory.
The blood portion of the test determines whether the kidneys are releasing renin into the blood stream and how active the chemical is.
In the experiment, blood and urine samples were obtained at New York City offices and factories from 1,717 workers found to have mild to moderate high blood pressure.
The patients' high blood pressure was initially discovered in a screening program carried out by Michael H. Alderman and his colleagues at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, who operate a work-site blood pressure control program in cooperation with local unions.
