``He even got down to do a cheerleader's squiggle.''
``He was up there saying, `Give me a W, give me an A,' and the customers went right along with him,'' Sively said.
He also joined the singer on stage to sing a duet and led customers in the Wal-Mart cheer.
Walton continued talking with customers during the concert.
Walton often attends promotional events for his Arkansas-based chain, and Sively said he had suspected the boss might make an appearance.
Walton, known for his down-home style, made a surprise visit to the store that later Tuesday staged a concert by country singer Jana Jea in its parking lot.
