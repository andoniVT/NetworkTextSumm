 The following is a recorded report filed by this station's reporter on the front lines of the province's battle against the flooding yesterday.
[Begin recording] Dear audience, it is now almost noon on 20 June.
You have inspected some flood-stricken areas in Changsha City this morning.
[Reporter] How are you, Governor Chen?
I interviewed Governor Chen Bangzhu here on the spot.
[Governor] This year, Hunan has been hit by a flood of a severity unseen for the past 100 years in terms of both water level and quantity.
At the moment, the province's flood situation remains very serious, because the water level is still high.
According to weather forecasts and meteorological reports, the province is expecting more rain to fall over the next few days.
We will definitely encounter more hardships and difficulties.
By four o'clock this afternoon the level recorded at the Changsha monitoring station had risen to 38.93 m, some 0.56 m higher than the highest figure ever previously recorded.
Most of the 15,000 people affected by the flood there have been evacuated to safer places.
But thanks to the concerted rescue efforts of 2,000 local cadres, residents and soldiers there was no loss of life.
By the early hours of this morning roads and surfaces of bridges in the Wangyuehu district had been inundated.
