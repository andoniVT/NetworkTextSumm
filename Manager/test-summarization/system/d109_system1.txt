This morning, Provincial Party Committee Secretary Wang Maolin, provincial Governor Chen Bangzhu, and some other provincial party and government leaders arrived here in Changshayuan, on the front line of the province's flood resistance effort, to direct the fight against the flooding.
Flood control work in the Pearl River (Zhujiang) Delta area is also very intense.
I interviewed Governor Chen Bangzhu here on the spot.
You have inspected some flood-stricken areas in Changsha City this morning.
Will you please tell our audience something about the province's flood situation?
As soon as they stepped out from the train, they set out for Changshayuan, the front line of the province's flood resistance.
At the moment, the province's flood situation remains very serious, because the water level is still high.
According to weather forecasts and meteorological reports, the province is expecting more rain to fall over the next few days.
