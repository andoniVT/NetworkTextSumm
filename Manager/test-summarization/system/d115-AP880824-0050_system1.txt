Nepalese officials listed 752 injured, down from their earlier estimate of 1,000.
The earthquake, which struck when most people were still asleep, registered 6.5 on the Richter scale and was the deadliest quake in the region since 1950, when a temblor in the east Indian state of Assam killed 1,500 by official count and 30,000 by seismologists' accounts.
Most of the homeless have moved in with neighbors or found shelter in tents erected on the soggy earth.
They put the India death count at anywhere from 400 to 1,500.
Most of the victims died in their houses, which were made of bricks held together by mud that had loosened during the seasonal monsoon rains.
