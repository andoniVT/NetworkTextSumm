In Dharan, men ran from houses to houses rousing people from their sleep.
The rumors started with anonymous telephone calls and spread by word of mouth.
Aftershocks have persisted since Sunday's quake, and rumors of an impending new quake sent thousands of people fleeing into the streets in panic before dawn Tuesday in Katmandu and Dharan.
The earthquake, which struck when most people were still asleep, registered 6.5 on the Richter scale and was the deadliest quake in the region since 1950, when a temblor in the east Indian state of Assam killed 1,500 by official count and 30,000 by seismologists' accounts.
