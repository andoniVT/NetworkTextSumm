``I think we'll learn a lot from an engineering point of view from this earthquake,'' he said.
The high probability is based on several factors, including length of time since the last major earthquake struck the area in 1906, said Clarence Allen, professor of Geology and Geophysics at the California Institue of Technology in Pasadena.
Allen said many of the same kinds of older structures that appeared to have been damaged in San Francisco also exist in the Los Angeles region.
Initial reports indicated widespread damage from Tuesday's quake, especially affecting highways and old masonry buildings.
It's something we should therefore be ready for,'' Allen said.
