That amount takes into consideration what St. Paul expects to recover under its reinsurance contracts, the company said.
When damages in North Carolina and Virginia are added, the company said, the payments will exceed $500 million.
Analysts said AIG has told them that it must cover the first $35 million of losses and that its reinsurance agreements will cover the bulk of the remaining damages.
 Damage from Hurricane Hugo, which stormed through the Carolinas and the Caribbean last week, will reduce third-quarter earnings for several insurers.
New York-based American International Group Inc. expects net losses related to Hugo to reduce pretax earnings between $35 million and $45 million.
