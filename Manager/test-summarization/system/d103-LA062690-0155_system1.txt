"The foreign media seems to think that by publishing news of aid from Salman Rushdie to earthquake victims, we will compromise on Rushdie's fatwa (edict)," Ayatollah Sadeq Khalkhali, known as the "Hanging Judge," said in Tehran.
The Indian-born writer has been out of public view since Feb. 14, 1989, when the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini sentenced him to death for writing "The Satanic Verses," a novel many Muslims regard as blasphemous.
"It's quite clear that at the moment, we should be thinking only of the humanitarian issue, which transcends all other discussion," said Rushdie, 42.
"I wanted to join the Independent and the hostage families and many other people in their appeal for contributions toward the needs of the Iranian earthquake victims," Rushdie said in a message delivered from his hiding place.
