"I wanted to join the Independent and the hostage families and many other people in their appeal for contributions toward the needs of the Iranian earthquake victims," Rushdie said in a message delivered from his hiding place.
 Writer Salman Rushdie, who has been sentenced to die by Iranian zealots, has donated $8,600 to victims of last week's devastating earthquake in Iran.
Iran said today his death order still stands.
Rushdie donated the money to the Independent Iranian Earthquake Appeal, organized by the Independent newspaper to help survivors of the earthquake that Iranian officials said left at least 50,000 people dead.
He indicated they would not.
